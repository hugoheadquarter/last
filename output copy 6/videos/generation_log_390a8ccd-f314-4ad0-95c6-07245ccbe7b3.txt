LINE 2: Your name is pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 이름이 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image 1 was a wide shot establishing the cafe meeting with a cheerful wave. Image 2 needs to zoom in closer for intimacy as they exchange names. This will be a medium-close shot focusing on the moment of introduction itself - showing genuine interest and connection through body language. Instead of a wide establishing shot, we're now in the conversation, capturing the warmth of someone sharing their name. The composition shifts from environmental context to interpersonal focus.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium-close shot of two young adults in a bright modern cafe during their first meeting, one person smiling warmly while introducing themselves, the other listening attentively with bright, interested eyes and a gentle smile. Both characters are positioned at slight angles to each other across a small cafe table, creating an intimate conversational space. Soft morning light filters through, casting gentle shadows. A small potted succulent and coffee cups sit between them on the marble-topped table. The friend receiving the name introduction has their hand placed softly near their heart in a gesture of genuine appreciation. Warm, welcoming atmosphere with coral pink, mint green, and soft yellow accents throughout. Bright, friendly flat illustration style with clean lines and rounded shapes. Modern Korean cafe aesthetic, minimalist but inviting.

REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-0
Selected indices: [0]
Reasoning:
Image 0 is the only available reference and it's the most recent. It features a wide shot with two young adults in a cafe with both characters clearly visible - one waving and one smiling back. This is a clean, straightforward composition without problematic framing elements like over-shoulder shots, POV angles, or foreground/background person separation. Since we only have one previous image and it matches our 2-person requirement with simple composition, selecting just this single reference is the safest approach to provide style consistency (bright modern cafe aesthetic, character designs, color palette) without risking compositional copying issues. Using fewer references reduces the chance of Seedream reinforcing any particular framing.

================================================================================
LINE 3: How old are you
================================================================================

Korean: 몇살이에요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1 and 2 showed the two characters interacting at their table in the cafe. For image 3, which focuses on the age question, I'm creating a distinctly different composition by zooming in on just ONE character - a close-up portrait shot of the person being asked the question. This single-character focus is compositionally different from the previous two-person wide and medium shots. The character is shown thinking/responding with a thoughtful, friendly expression, perhaps with a hand gesture indicating their age or a contemplative pose. This creates visual variety while maintaining the conversation context - we're now seeing the individual's reaction to being asked about their age.

Seedream Prompt:
Close-up portrait shot of a young adult in a bright modern cafe, looking directly forward with a friendly, thoughtful smile while responding to a question about their age. Warm natural lighting on their face. Soft-focus cafe background with hints of coral pink and mint green decor. Character has a relaxed, open expression showing comfort in the conversation. Bright, friendly flat illustration style with soft pastel colors, clean modern aesthetic with rounded shapes. Welcoming and cheerful mood, minimalist but warm Korean-inspired design aesthetic.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-1
Selected indices: [1]
Reasoning:
Selecting only Image 1 (medium-close shot) because it provides clear character design and cafe style reference while showing both people cleanly visible during conversation. Image 0 (wide shot with waving) has different enough composition that using both could create compositional confusion. Since we only have 2 previous images and they're both recent and appropriate, selecting just 1 is the safest approach to provide style consistency without over-reinforcing any particular framing. Image 1's medium-close conversational setup is most relevant for the age question exchange.

================================================================================
LINE 4: You look so young
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 어려보여요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1-3 have been progressively zooming in on the conversation (wide → medium-close → close-up portrait). For image 4, I need a completely different compositional approach. The lyric 'You look so young' suggests one person observing/commenting on the other's youthful appearance. Instead of continuing the zoom pattern, I'll create a two-shot from a fresh angle - a side-by-side or slightly angled view that captures one person's reaction to noticing how young the other looks. This breaks from the previous frontal/portrait compositions and creates a moment of observation and gentle surprise.

Seedream Prompt:
Side-by-side medium shot of two young adults sitting at a cafe table, viewed from a slight angle. On the left, a person with short dark hair looks slightly surprised with raised eyebrows and a gentle smile, leaning forward slightly in observation. On the right, another person with longer hair sits naturally, looking youthful and cheerful with a bright smile. Bright modern cafe setting with soft pastel colors - coral pink, mint green, sky blue, warm yellow. Clean flat illustration style with rounded shapes. Coffee cups on the table between them. Soft natural lighting creates a warm, friendly atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the moment of one person noticing and commenting on the other's youthful appearance.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-2
Selected indices: [2]
Reasoning:
Image 2 is a close-up portrait with straightforward, clean framing - the character looks directly forward with no complex compositional elements. Since all three previous images are from the same cafe scene with similar compositions (wide shot, medium-close, then close-up progression), selecting only the most recent ensures style consistency while minimizing compositional reinforcement. The close-up portrait is the safest choice as it has the simplest composition with no over-shoulder angles, backs, or layered elements that could cause Seedream to duplicate the framing for this 'you look so young' compliment line.

LINE 5: What is your hobby
================================================================================

Korean: 취미가 뭐예요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1-4 have focused on the two people meeting and conversing at a cafe table. Image 1 was a wide shot of the greeting, Image 2 was medium-close of them talking, Image 3 was a close-up portrait of one person, and Image 4 was a side-by-side medium shot. For image 5, with the lyric asking about hobbies, I want to create visual interest by showing BOTH characters simultaneously sharing/expressing their interests through a creative split-screen or dual-panel composition. This moves away from the standard conversation framing and creates a more dynamic, illustrative moment that visualizes the concept of 'hobbies' rather than just showing people asking about them. This is compositionally distinct as it breaks from the single unified scene into a visual representation of two different hobby scenarios.

Seedream Prompt:
Split composition illustration showing two different hobby scenes side by side, separated by a soft vertical divider. Left panel: young adult with short dark hair doing a creative hobby like painting or drawing, surrounded by art supplies, watercolor palette, and sketches, sitting cross-legged on the floor with focused expression. Right panel: another young adult with shoulder-length hair reading a book in a cozy setting, surrounded by stacked books, a potted plant, and a steaming mug of tea. Bright flat illustration style with soft pastel colors - coral pink, mint green, sky blue, warm yellow. Clean modern aesthetic with rounded shapes. Both panels equally sized, creating a balanced diptych showing two people's different hobbies. Cheerful, warm lighting. Contemporary Korean design influence with minimalist but inviting atmosphere.

REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-3
Selected indices: [1, 3]
Reasoning:
Image 1 provides a medium-close shot with both people clearly visible during conversation - clean composition that won't cause framing issues. Image 3 is a side-by-side medium shot showing both people at the table from a straightforward angle, avoiding problematic over-shoulder or POV elements. Both images have simple, clear compositions with 2 people matching the current scene's character count. Skipping Image 0 (too wide/establishing) and Image 2 (single person close-up) to maintain focus on conversational two-person setups that work for a 'discussing hobbies' moment. Using only 2 refs reduces compositional reinforcement risk.

LINE 6: I like it too
================================================================================

Korean: 저도 좋아해요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1-5 have shown: wide cafe shot with wave, medium-close of two people, single close-up portrait, side-by-side sitting at table, and split-screen hobbies. For this 'I like it too' moment of agreement/connection, I'm creating a unique composition: a TOP-DOWN BIRD'S EYE VIEW of the cafe table between them, showing their hands/arms gesturing enthusiastically toward each other across the table surface, with coffee cups and the table creating the central focus. This aerial perspective hasn't been used yet and perfectly captures the moment of mutual enthusiasm and agreement - two people leaning in, animated, connecting over shared interests. It's visually distinct while maintaining the conversational intimacy.

Seedream Prompt:
Bird's eye view illustration looking straight down at a round cafe table from above. Two pairs of arms reach across the table toward each other in animated, enthusiastic gestures - hands open and expressive, showing excitement and agreement. On the table surface between them are two coffee cups with latte art, a small plant in a ceramic pot, and soft shadows. The person on the left wears a coral pink long-sleeved shirt, the person on the right wears a mint green top. Warm wooden table surface. Bright, friendly flat illustration style with soft pastel colors, clean modern aesthetic with rounded shapes. Top-down perspective, overhead view, aerial angle. Cheerful and warm mood capturing the moment of finding common ground.

Reasoning:
Image 1 provides a clean medium-close shot with both people visible during introduction - simple composition that won't create problematic framing. Image 3 offers a side-by-side medium shot showing both characters clearly at the table, which is compositionally straightforward. Both avoid over-shoulder, POV, or foreground/background layering issues. I'm selecting only 2 refs (not 3) because Images 3 and 4 share split/side-by-side compositions - picking both would reinforce that framing too heavily. Image 4's split-panel hobby scenes could cause Seedream to replicate the divided composition structure. Sticking with 2 diverse but safe references minimizes compositional copying while maintaining style consistency.

LINE 7: Where did you get that clothe
================================================================================

Korean: 그 옷 어디서 샀어요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is image #7, focusing on a fashion/style compliment. Previous images covered: wide intro shot, medium conversation, close-up portrait, side-by-side at table, split hobby scenes, and overhead table view. To be visually distinct, I'll create a medium shot focusing on the clothing detail itself - showing one person gesturing admiringly toward the other person's outfit. The composition will be angled from the side, capturing the natural body language of giving a compliment (pointing, leaning in with interest). This differs from all previous angles: it's not a wide establishing shot, not straight-on portraits, not overhead, and not a split composition. The focus is on the interaction moment of noticing and complimenting style.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium side-angle shot in a bright modern cafe, one young adult enthusiastically gesturing toward and admiring the clothing of another young adult who is standing or sitting nearby. The person giving the compliment has an animated, impressed expression with eyes focused on the outfit, perhaps pointing or reaching slightly toward the fabric. The person receiving the compliment looks pleasantly surprised and a bit bashful, smiling. Emphasis on showing the stylish clothing details - perhaps a patterned shirt, nice jacket, or trendy outfit in coral pink or mint green tones. Bright natural lighting, soft pastel color palette with warm yellows and sky blues. Cafe atmosphere visible but blurred in background with plants and modern furniture. Friendly, encouraging body language capturing the moment of noticing someone's great style. Flat illustration style with clean lines and rounded shapes.

Reasoning:
Image 1 provides a medium-close shot with both people clearly visible during conversation - clean composition that won't create problematic framing for a clothing compliment scene. Image 3 offers a side-by-side medium shot at a cafe table with both characters fully visible from a slight angle, providing good style reference for seated interaction without risky POV or over-shoulder elements. These two refs give compositional variety (one closer, one wider) while keeping both subjects visible and avoiding foreground/background layering issues. Image 5 (bird's eye view) is too compositionally specific and would likely be copied. Images 0, 2, 4 are less relevant to the intimate moment of noticing someone's clothing.

LINE 8: It's so pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image 7 showed one person gesturing toward/admiring the other's clothing from a side angle at medium distance. Image 8 needs to be visually distinct while maintaining the compliment theme. Instead of showing the admirer gesturing, I'll create an extreme close-up of fabric/clothing details - showing what's being admired. This shifts from 'person giving compliment' to 'subject of compliment'. The composition will be a detailed close-up crop focusing on clothing texture, accessories, or style details (like a collar, sleeve, pattern, or accessory), possibly with just a hint of the person wearing it. This creates visual variety through: 1) Extreme close-up vs medium shot, 2) Focus on object/details vs people interaction, 3) Abstract/artistic framing vs traditional character positioning. It maintains story continuity (the compliment moment) while being compositionally fresh.

Seedream Prompt:
Extreme close-up illustration of fashionable clothing details, showing fabric texture and stylish design elements. Focus on a colorful garment with interesting patterns or textures - perhaps a coral pink or mint green piece with modern Korean fashion aesthetic. Soft pastel colors, clean lines, and gentle lighting that highlights the fabric quality and style. Small decorative details like buttons, embroidery, or accessories partially visible. Bright, friendly flat illustration style with rounded shapes and warm tones. The composition is tightly cropped on the clothing itself, creating an intimate, detailed view that shows why the outfit is receiving compliments. Shallow depth of field effect with soft bokeh in background suggesting cafe atmosphere.

Reasoning:
Image 5 (bird's eye view of table with arms) provides a unique overhead perspective that won't interfere with a standard compliment-giving shot, plus establishes the cafe table setting and color palette. Image 6 (medium side-angle of one person admiring another's clothing) is the most recent and thematically relevant for a compliment scene - it shows both characters clearly visible without problematic foreground/background layering or over-shoulder framing. Using only 2 references minimizes compositional reinforcement while providing the style context needed for this compliment moment.

LINE 9: Do you want to be friends?
================================================================================

Korean: 우리 친구할래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is THE pivotal moment - the friend invitation - which needs to feel special and distinct. Previous images showed: wide intro, medium conversation, close-up portrait, side-by-side at table, split hobby scenes, bird's eye table view, side-angle admiring, and extreme close-up of clothing. For this climactic moment, I'm using a frontal medium-wide shot of both people standing/leaning toward each other with one person extending their hand in a friendly gesture of invitation. This creates a sense of openness, warmth, and the exciting possibility of new friendship. The composition is symmetrical and welcoming, showing both faces clearly with hopeful expressions, distinct from all previous angles and framings.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium-wide frontal shot of two young adults in a bright modern cafe, both visible from waist up, facing toward the viewer at a slight angle toward each other. One person on the left extends their hand forward in a friendly, inviting gesture with an warm, hopeful smile. The other person on the right leans in slightly with an excited, enthusiastic expression, hands clasped together in delighted anticipation. Cafe background softly blurred with warm natural lighting, potted plants and warm wood tones visible. Both characters have open, welcoming body language creating a sense of connection and new friendship forming. Bright, friendly flat illustration style with soft pastel colors (coral pink, mint green, sky blue, warm yellow), clean modern aesthetic with rounded shapes, cheerful and optimistic mood.

Available images: 0-7
Selected indices: [1, 5]
Reasoning:
Image 1 provides a clean medium-close shot with both people visible and engaged in conversation - good for character design and friendly interaction style without problematic framing. Image 5 offers a bird's eye view of the table with arms reaching across, which is compositionally very different from the current scene (preventing duplication) while providing excellent reference for the welcoming gesture and cafe setting aesthetic. Using only 2 refs keeps compositional influence minimal. Avoiding Image 3 (side-by-side could be too similar to needed framing), Image 6 (side-angle with gesturing might copy too literally), and Images 4/7 (split compositions and extreme close-ups are too different in character count/framing).

LINE 10: Do you wanna drink coffee?
================================================================================

Korean: 커피 마실래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the final image that needs to bring the sequence to a satisfying, visually distinct conclusion. Previous images have shown: wide establishment shots, medium conversations, close-ups of faces, side-by-side comparisons, bird's eye table views, fashion detail close-ups, and frontal two-person shots. For this coffee invitation finale, I'll create something new: a warm, celebratory composition focusing on the symbolic gesture of coffee itself. I'll use an intimate angled shot featuring two coffee cups being raised together in a toast-like gesture (clinking or about to clink), with the characters' hands and partial torsos visible but faces not the focus - instead the coffee cups become the visual centerpiece. This creates a sense of agreement, friendship sealed, and forward momentum. The angle will be slightly elevated, looking down at about 45 degrees to capture both the cups and the table surface, with warm lighting suggesting a golden hour glow. This composition is completely different from all previous shots - it's object-focused rather than face-focused, uses diagonal energy, and symbolically represents the 'yes' to friendship through the physical act of sharing coffee.

Seedream Prompt:
Illustration of two coffee cups gently touching together in a friendly toast gesture, viewed from a 45-degree elevated angle looking down. The cups are held by two people's hands reaching in from opposite sides of the frame. One cup is a warm coral-pink ceramic mug, the other is a mint-green cup. The hands and lower arms are visible wearing casual, stylish clothing. A round cafe table surface is visible below with soft shadows. Bright, warm golden-hour lighting creates a cozy, celebratory atmosphere. Background is softly blurred showing hints of a modern cafe interior with pastel colors. Bright, friendly flat illustration style with soft pastel color palette (coral pink, mint green, sky blue, warm yellow). Clean, modern aesthetic with rounded shapes. Welcoming and cheerful mood. Contemporary Korean design sensibility - minimalist but warm. The composition emphasizes the moment of connection and agreement through the coffee toast gesture.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-8
Selected indices: [8, 1]
Reasoning:
Image 8 is the most recent and shows both people clearly visible from waist up in a frontal medium-wide shot - clean composition without problematic framing elements. Image 1 provides similar clean framing with both characters visible during introduction. Both avoid over-shoulder, POV, or back-to-camera angles that could cause duplication. I'm selecting only 2 references rather than 3 because: (1) the current scene is a simple conversation moment that doesn't need heavy style reinforcement, and (2) fewer references reduces risk of compositional copying. Images 3-7 either have split/complex compositions or extreme close-ups that could cause issues, while 0 is too distant. This selection provides consistent cafe atmosphere and character design without reinforcing any problematic framing.
