LINE 2: Your name is pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 이름이 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image 1 showed the female character approaching with a friendly wave, introducing herself. For Image 2 ('Your name is pretty'), I'm creating a distinctly different composition: a two-shot medium close-up capturing both characters' reactions during their conversation. The male character is now actively engaged, visible in the frame, showing his response to her compliment. The camera angle shifts to a more intimate side perspective, showing their faces in profile/three-quarter view as they exchange dialogue. The framing brings them closer together, suggesting the conversation is deepening. Their body language and positioning show mutual engagement - no longer just her approaching, but both participating. This creates visual variety through: different camera distance (closer), different angle (side view vs front), both characters equally prominent in frame, and different emotional beat (compliment exchange vs initial greeting).

Seedream Prompt:
Medium close-up shot of two young characters having a friendly conversation in a bright modern cafe, warm pastel color palette with soft pinks yellows and blues. On the left, a young male character with neat short brown hair, kind expressive eyes, wearing a casual soft blue button-up shirt, showing a slightly bashful but pleased smile, eyes bright with friendly interest. On the right, a young female character with soft brown hair in a casual ponytail with loose strands framing her face, wearing a cozy cream-colored cardigan over a pastel pink t-shirt, small earrings visible, gentle brown eyes sparkling with warmth, genuine friendly smile as she speaks. Both characters shown from shoulders up, angled slightly toward each other in natural conversational positioning. Softly blurred cafe interior background with warm lighting, hints of cafe windows and soft furniture, pastel tones throughout. Clean modern aesthetic, bright and welcoming atmosphere, simple animated style with expressive approachable faces, contemporary animation with smooth lines and friendly features, professional high quality digital illustration, cinematic composition capturing a moment of genuine connection and compliment exchange.

LINE 3: How old are you
================================================================================

Korean: 몇살이에요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes show: (1) female character solo introduction, (2) medium close-up conversation between both characters. For scene 3 with the 'age question' lyric, I need distinct visual variety. I'll create an over-the-shoulder shot from behind the female character, looking at the male character as he responds to her question. This creates intimacy and perspective shift - we're positioned with her, waiting for his answer. The male character will be gesturing naturally (perhaps touching his chin thoughtfully or counting on fingers playfully) while answering. This camera angle is completely different from the previous frontal/medium shots, adds depth to the cafe environment behind him, and shows the conversation dynamic from her point of view.

Seedream Prompt:
Over-the-shoulder shot from behind a young female character with soft brown hair in a casual ponytail, wearing a cozy cream-colored cardigan over a pastel pink t-shirt, looking at a young male character facing her in a bright modern cafe. The male character has neat short brown hair, kind expressive eyes, wearing a casual soft blue button-up shirt, making a thoughtful friendly gesture with his hand near his chin while speaking, warm genuine smile on his face. Detailed cafe environment visible behind him with wooden tables, soft hanging lights, potted plants, and large windows with natural daylight streaming in. Warm pastel color palette with soft pinks, yellows, and blues, bright welcoming atmosphere, clean modern aesthetic, friendly animated style with expressive character faces, smooth lines, professional high quality digital illustration, conversational moment, approachable and cheerful mood.

LINE 4: You look so young
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 어려보여요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes showed: (1) female character alone looking curious, (2) medium close-up of both in conversation, (3) over-the-shoulder shot from behind female. For image 4 with the lyric 'You look so young', I'll create a close-up shot from the male character's perspective, showing the female character's youthful appearance as he observes her. This gives us a new camera angle (reverse of image 3's perspective), focusing on her face with a slightly tilted head gesture suggesting friendly curiosity or slight embarrassment at the comment. The framing will be tighter than image 2, showing her upper body and face more prominently, with the male character partially visible in the foreground (back of his head/shoulder) to maintain both characters in frame and show this is his viewpoint during their ongoing conversation.

Seedream Prompt:
Close-up shot from male character's perspective in a bright modern cafe, showing a young female character with soft brown hair in a casual ponytail with loose strands framing her face, wearing a cozy cream-colored cardigan over a pastel pink t-shirt, gentle brown eyes with kind expression, simple small earrings, natural makeup. She has a warm friendly smile with a slight head tilt, looking directly at camera with an approachable youthful expression. Partial view of male character's shoulder and back of head with neat short brown hair and soft blue button-up shirt visible in foreground left side. Bright cafe interior background with pastel wooden furniture, soft window light, warm atmosphere. Warm pastel color palette with soft pinks, yellows, and blues, clean modern aesthetic, friendly animated style with expressive faces, cheerful welcoming mood, smooth lines, contemporary animation, high quality digital illustration, 1920x1080 cinematic composition

LINE 5: What is your hobby
================================================================================

Korean: 취미가 뭐예요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes have shown: (1) female character alone looking curious, (2) medium close-up conversation, (3) over-the-shoulder from behind female, (4) close-up from male's perspective of female's face. For scene 5 on the 'hobby' lyric, I'll create a distinctly different composition: a side-by-side medium shot showing both characters seated at the cafe table from a perpendicular angle, capturing their body language and the cafe environment more fully. The female character will have an inquisitive, engaged posture leaning slightly forward asking the question, while the male character responds with thoughtful, friendly body language. This gives us a fresh perspective showing their spatial relationship, the table between them, and more of the cafe setting, creating visual variety through wider framing and different character positioning.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium side shot of two young characters sitting across from each other at a small round wooden cafe table in a bright modern cafe, warm pastel color palette with soft pinks yellows and blues. Left side: young female character with soft brown hair in a casual ponytail with loose strands framing her face, wearing a cozy cream-colored cardigan over a pastel pink t-shirt, leaning forward slightly with engaged curious expression, one hand gesturing gently in conversation. Right side: young male character with neat short brown hair, kind expressive eyes, wearing a casual soft blue button-up shirt, sitting upright with friendly attentive expression, hands resting on table. Two coffee cups on table between them. Bright cafe interior background with blurred pastries display case, hanging plants, warm natural lighting through windows, clean modern aesthetic. Simple animated style with expressive approachable faces, cheerful welcoming mood, contemporary animation with smooth lines, professional character art, cinematic composition showing full upper bodies and environment, high quality digital illustration

LINE 6: I like it too
================================================================================

Korean: 저도 좋아해요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes showed: 1) Female character alone looking curious, 2) Medium close-up conversation, 3) Over-shoulder shot from female's perspective, 4) Close-up from male's perspective, 5) Side view of both at table. For this 'I like it too' moment of agreement and connection, I'm creating a distinct warm moment with a NEW ANGLE: a slightly elevated medium shot capturing both characters from a diagonal front angle, showing them leaning in with animated, enthusiastic agreement gestures. The female character is gesturing expressively with her hands up in an excited 'me too!' motion, while the male character mirrors her enthusiasm with a bright smile and nodding gesture. This creates visual variety through: 1) Different camera height/angle (elevated diagonal), 2) New character blocking with both leaning forward, 3) Expressive hand gestures showing shared excitement, 4) More dynamic body language than previous static sitting poses, 5) Capturing the energy of finding common ground.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium shot from a slightly elevated diagonal front angle of two young characters having an enthusiastic moment of connection at a small round wooden cafe table in a bright modern cafe. The female character on the left has soft brown hair in a casual ponytail with loose strands framing her face, wearing a cozy cream-colored cardigan over a pastel pink t-shirt, leaning forward with an excited animated expression, hands raised in an expressive 'me too!' gesture, eyes bright and engaged. The male character on the right has neat short brown hair and kind expressive eyes, wearing a casual soft blue button-up shirt, leaning forward with a warm enthusiastic smile, nodding in agreement. Two coffee cups on the wooden table between them. Background shows softly blurred modern cafe interior with warm lighting, pastel-colored walls, hanging plants, and soft window light. Bright pastel color palette with soft pinks, yellows, and blues. Clean modern aesthetic, friendly animated style with simple character designs, warm and welcoming mood, contemporary animation style with smooth lines, cheerful atmosphere showing moment of shared interest and connection, high quality digital illustration.

LINE 7: Where did you get that clothe
================================================================================

Korean: 그 옷 어디서 샀어요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes showed: (1) female alone approaching, (2) medium close-up conversation, (3) over-shoulder from female's view, (4) close-up from male's POV, (5) medium side shot at table, (6) elevated diagonal front angle. For image 7 focusing on the clothing compliment lyric, I'll create a distinct visual by using a LOW ANGLE shot looking UP at the male character standing, with the female character visible in foreground/side examining or gesturing toward his blue shirt. This creates dynamic vertical composition we haven't used yet, emphasizes the clothing being discussed, and shows active engagement with different body language - one standing, one seated or leaning in. This angle and staging is completely different from all seated/level conversation shots.

Seedream Prompt:
Low angle shot looking upward in a bright modern cafe with warm pastel color palette, young male character standing in three-quarter view wearing a casual soft blue button-up shirt, neat short brown hair, kind expressive eyes, friendly warm smile looking down, young female character with soft brown hair in casual ponytail with loose strands framing face visible in lower foreground, wearing cozy cream-colored cardigan over pastel pink t-shirt, reaching toward or gesturing appreciatively at the male character's blue shirt, warm enthusiastic expression, detailed cafe environment with wooden furniture, soft window lighting, plants, warm pastel tones of soft pinks yellows and blues, friendly animated style with clean modern aesthetic, expressive character faces showing clothing appreciation moment, natural casual interaction, cheerful welcoming mood, contemporary animation style with smooth lines, professional character art, high quality digital illustration

LINE 8: It's so pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes have shown: close-ups, over-shoulder shots, sitting at table, standing interactions, and elevated angles. Image 7 was a low angle of the male character standing. For image 8 with the lyric 'It's so pretty / 너무 예뻐요' (compliment about appearance/clothing), I'll create a distinct moment: a medium shot from the female character's perspective, slightly angled, capturing the male character's shy/flattered reaction to her compliment, with her partially visible in the foreground (back of shoulder/hair) to show she's the one speaking. This creates an intimate POV moment we haven't used yet, showing his bashful response to her kind words. The composition will be asymmetrical with depth, different from all previous framings.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium shot from female character's point of view in a bright modern cafe with warm pastel color palette (soft pinks, yellows, blues), young male character centered in frame with a shy flattered smile and slight blush on cheeks, looking down modestly then back up with warm expression, neat short brown hair, kind expressive eyes, wearing casual soft blue button-up shirt, standing/leaning slightly by cafe table. Partial view of female character in foreground lower left (back of shoulder showing cozy cream cardigan, side of soft brown ponytail with loose strands), showing she is speaking to him. Background shows bright cafe interior with large windows, soft sunlight, potted plants, wooden furniture, pastel colored walls. Natural depth of field with male character in sharp focus, welcoming and friendly atmosphere, clean modern aesthetic, simple animated style with expressive character design, cheerful mood, contemporary illustration style, high quality digital art

LINE 9: Do you want to be friends?
================================================================================

Korean: 우리 친구할래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene marks the pivotal friendship invitation moment. Looking at previous shots: we've had medium close-ups, over-shoulder, POV shots, side angles, elevated diagonal, low angle looking up, and medium shot from female's POV. For this climactic moment of the invitation, I'll create a warm, cinematic two-shot from a slightly LOW FRONT ANGLE capturing both characters at the table together, with the female character leaning forward earnestly with an inviting gesture (perhaps hand extended slightly or both hands clasped hopefully on the table), while the male character responds with surprised delight. This angle makes the moment feel important and intimate, different from all previous framings. The composition centers on their connection across the table with both clearly visible, emphasizing the significance of this friendship proposal.

Seedream Prompt:
Low front angle shot in a bright modern cafe with warm pastel color palette (soft pinks, yellows, blues), two young characters sitting across from each other at a small round wooden cafe table. Female character on left side: soft brown hair in casual ponytail with loose strands framing face, wearing cozy cream-colored cardigan over pastel pink t-shirt, leaning forward with warm inviting smile and hopeful expression, hands gently clasped together or one hand extended slightly on table in friendly welcoming gesture, kind brown eyes bright with anticipation. Male character on right side: neat short brown hair, wearing casual soft blue button-up shirt, looking at her with surprised pleased smile and touched expression, leaning slightly back in natural reaction to invitation, kind expressive eyes showing genuine happiness. Two coffee cups on wooden table between them. Soft cafe interior details visible in background with blurred bokeh lights, warm window lighting, potted plants, clean modern aesthetic. Cinematic composition emphasizing the meaningful friendship invitation moment, bright cheerful atmosphere, simple character designs with expressive approachable faces, professional quality digital illustration with smooth lines and contemporary animation style.

LINE 10: Do you wanna drink coffee?
================================================================================

Korean: 커피 마실래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the climactic invitation moment - the coffee offer. Previous scenes showed: individual reactions, seated conversations at the table, standing moments, and various angles of their interaction. For this final scene, I want to capture the warmth of acceptance and friendship forming. I'll use a medium-wide shot that shows both characters together at the cafe table with TWO coffee cups now present between them, symbolizing the acceptance of her invitation. The female character is gesturing welcomingly toward the coffees, while the male character is leaning in with an enthusiastic accepting expression. This is different because: (1) it's the first time we clearly see coffee cups as props between them on the table, (2) the framing is wider to show the complete 'moment of connection' with full context, (3) their body language is more open and forward-leaning toward each other showing mutual engagement, (4) the camera is at a natural eye-level medium distance rather than close-ups or dramatic angles, giving a 'settled friendship' feeling. This contrasts with previous seated shots by including the coffee as a central visual element and showing both characters in a more relaxed, connected posture.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium-wide shot at eye level in a bright modern cafe with warm pastel color palette (soft pinks, yellows, blues), two young characters sitting across from each other at a small round wooden cafe table with two steaming coffee cups placed between them. Left side: young female character with soft brown hair in a casual ponytail with loose strands framing her face, wearing a cozy cream-colored cardigan over a pastel pink t-shirt, simple small earrings, leaning forward with one hand gesturing welcomingly toward the coffee cups, warm genuine smile, eyes sparkling with friendliness. Right side: young male character with neat short brown hair and kind expressive eyes, wearing a casual soft blue button-up shirt, leaning forward enthusiastically with both hands on the table near his coffee cup, bright accepting smile, engaged body language showing eagerness. Both characters occupy equal frame space with good separation, cafe interior visible behind them with soft-focus windows, plants, and warm lighting creating an inviting atmosphere. Clean modern aesthetic, simple animated style with expressive approachable faces, cheerful welcoming mood, professional character art showing the moment of friendship forming over coffee, high quality digital illustration
