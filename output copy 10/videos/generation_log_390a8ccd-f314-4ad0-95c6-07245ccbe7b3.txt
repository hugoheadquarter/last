LINE 2: Your name is pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 이름이 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image 1 showed both characters sitting across from each other at the table in a wide establishing shot. For Image 2, I'm creating a distinctly different angle by using a close-up over-the-shoulder perspective from behind the male character, focusing on the female character's face as she reacts warmly to his compliment about her name. This creates visual variety through: 1) Closer framing (medium close-up vs wide shot), 2) Different camera angle (OTS instead of neutral wide), 3) More intimate composition showing her flattered expression, 4) The male character now partially visible in foreground blur. The cafe environment remains visible but softer in the background, maintaining continuity while the focus shifts to capturing her emotional reaction to the compliment.

Seedream Prompt:
Over-the-shoulder shot from behind the male character showing the female character's face in medium close-up as she smiles warmly and looks slightly bashful, her eyes bright and pleased. She sits across the cafe table, wearing the same outfit from the reference portrait. The male character's shoulder and back of his head visible in soft focus in the foreground left side. Cozy cafe interior with warm lighting, blurred cafe details in background including windows, plants, and warm pendant lights. Bright cheerful animation style with warm pastel colors - soft pinks, yellows and blues. Clean modern aesthetic with friendly approachable mood, simple expressive character design suitable for educational content.

LINE 3: How old are you
================================================================================

Korean: 몇살이에요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous images showed: 1) A wide two-shot of both characters sitting at the table, and 2) An over-the-shoulder shot focusing on the female character's reaction. For variety, this scene shows a different angle - a close-up side profile shot of the male character as he asks the question 'How old are you?', with the female character visible but slightly out of focus in the background across the table. This creates visual variety through: closer framing, side angle composition, depth of field technique, and focus on the male character (who was only shown from behind previously). The cafe environment remains visible with warm lighting and table details.

Seedream Prompt:
Close-up side profile shot of the male character from the reference portrait, showing him from the shoulders up as he speaks with a friendly, curious expression, slight smile, eyes engaged. The female character from the reference portrait is visible across the small round cafe table in the softer-focused background, creating depth. Warm cafe interior with soft natural window light, coffee cups and small details on the wooden table surface between them. Bright, cheerful animation style with warm pastel colors - soft pinks, yellows, and blues. Clean modern aesthetic with friendly approachable mood, simple but expressive character designs.

================================================================================
LINE 4: You look so young
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 어려보여요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous images showed: (1) wide shot of both at table, (2) over-shoulder to female, (3) close-up side profile of male. This scene needs distinct variety. The lyric is about commenting on youthful appearance, so I'll create a two-shot medium close-up from a FRONT-FACING ANGLE showing both characters' faces clearly as they look at each other across the table. The male is reacting/commenting while the female responds to his observation. This differs by: showing both faces simultaneously in frame, frontal camera angle (not over-shoulder or profile), intimate framing that captures their mutual eye contact and reaction to the compliment, and includes environmental cafe details in background.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium close-up frontal shot of the male and female characters from the reference portraits sitting across from each other at a cafe table, both visible in frame from chest up. The male character on the left side is leaning forward slightly with a friendly, observant expression as he speaks. The female character on the right side has a surprised but pleased smile, perhaps touching her face in a modest gesture. Warm cafe interior visible in soft focus behind them with pendant lights, potted plants on shelves, and warm wood tones. Soft natural light from a window creates a warm glow. The composition captures both their faces clearly as they make eye contact. Bright, cheerful animation style with warm pastel colors, clean modern aesthetic, friendly and approachable mood.

LINE 5: What is your hobby
================================================================================

Korean: 취미가 뭐예요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene differs significantly from previous shots by using a wide establishing angle that shows the full cafe environment and both characters' body language. Unlike the previous close-ups and over-shoulder shots, this pulls back to show the male character leaning forward with animated hand gestures as he asks about hobbies, while the female character sits attentively. The wider framing reveals more of the cafe setting with tables, chairs, and background details, creating environmental context. The male character is actively gesturing to illustrate the question about hobbies, adding physical movement and energy distinct from the previous static conversation shots.

Seedream Prompt:
Wide angle shot of a cozy modern cafe interior with the male and female characters from the reference portraits sitting at a small round table in the center-left of frame. The male character leans forward enthusiastically with both hands raised in an animated, questioning gesture as he asks about hobbies, his expression curious and engaged. The female character sits across from him, leaning slightly back with an interested smile, hands resting on the table. The cafe has warm lighting, with other small tables and chairs visible in the background, potted plants on windowsills, pendant lights hanging from the ceiling, and a counter with a coffee machine in the soft-focus background. Warm pastel color palette with soft pinks, yellows, and cream tones. Bright, cheerful animation style with clean lines and friendly aesthetic.

================================================================================
LINE 6: I like it too
================================================================================

Korean: 저도 좋아해요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene needs to show the moment of shared interest/agreement between the characters. Previous images include: (1) wide establishing shot, (2) over-shoulder of female, (3) side profile of male, (4) frontal medium close-up of both, (5) wide cafe interior. To create visual variety, I'll do a dynamic two-shot from a slightly elevated angle, showing both characters leaning in toward each other across the table with engaged, enthusiastic body language - capturing the warmth of discovering they have something in common. This differs from image 4's frontal shot by having more dynamic positioning, closer framing on their interaction, and capturing the excitement of the moment with more animated gestures.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium shot from a slightly elevated angle showing the male and female characters from the reference portraits sitting across from each other at a small round cafe table, both leaning forward with enthusiastic, engaged body language as they discover a shared interest. The female character has her hands gesturing expressively near her chest, while the male character leans in with an warm smile and attentive posture. On the wooden table between them are coffee cups, a small potted plant, and casual cafe items. The background shows soft-focused cafe interior with warm pendant lighting, blurred windows, and cozy seating areas. Bright, cheerful animation style with warm pastel color palette of soft pinks, yellows, and blues. Clean modern aesthetic with friendly, approachable mood capturing the excitement of connection.

LINE 7: Where did you get that clothe
================================================================================

Korean: 그 옷 어디서 샀어요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene breaks from previous shots by focusing on a DETAIL - the female character's clothing. While previous images showed conversational exchanges with various angles (over-shoulder, profiles, wide shots, elevated angles), this image creates visual variety by showing a close-up detail shot of the female character's outfit being admired, with the male character visible but slightly out of focus in the background. This creates depth and emphasizes the lyric's focus on noticing her clothes. The camera angle is lower and more intimate, focusing on torso/clothing level rather than faces.

Seedream Prompt:
Close-up detail shot in a cozy modern cafe showing the female character from the reference portrait from chest to lap level, wearing a stylish pastel-colored blouse or cardigan with delicate details, her hands resting on the table near a coffee cup. The male character from the reference portrait is visible but slightly blurred in the background across the table, leaning forward with an admiring expression. Warm afternoon sunlight streaming through cafe windows illuminates the fabric texture of her clothing. Soft bokeh effect on background. Bright cheerful animation style with warm pastel colors, clean modern aesthetic, simple expressive character designs.

LINE 8: It's so pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene breaks from the seated conversation pattern of previous images. Instead of showing them sitting across from each other at the table, this creates an intimate close-up of the male character's perspective as he looks at and compliments the female character. The 'It's so pretty/너무 예뻐요' lyric suggests he's complimenting her appearance, so we show a soft-focused romantic POV shot where the female character is the center of attention, slightly closer and more portrait-like than previous angles. This shifts from wide/medium cafe shots to an intimate, almost dreamlike close-up that captures the moment of compliment and admiration.

Seedream Prompt:
Close-up shot from the male character's point of view showing the female character from the reference portrait in soft romantic focus, seated at the cafe table with warm afternoon sunlight streaming through a nearby window creating a gentle glow around her. She has a slightly surprised but pleased expression, looking down shyly with a subtle smile. The background cafe interior is softly blurred with bokeh effects showing warm golden lights and pastel-colored walls. Her hands are visible resting on the table near a coffee cup. The lighting is warm and ethereal with soft pinks and golden tones. Bright, cheerful animation style with warm pastel colors, clean modern aesthetic, friendly approachable mood.

LINE 9: Do you want to be friends?
================================================================================

Korean: 우리 친구할래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene marks the pivotal friendship proposal moment, so it needs to feel special and different from all previous shots. Unlike the previous close-ups and medium shots across the table, this will be a LOW ANGLE shot looking UP at the male character as he leans forward slightly with an inviting, hopeful expression, extending his hand across the table in a gesture of friendship. The camera is positioned almost at table level, creating a dynamic perspective we haven't used yet. The female character's hands are visible in the lower foreground reaching toward his in response. This angle creates visual drama and emphasizes the significance of this moment - the actual friendship offer - while maintaining the warm cafe environment with background elements visible behind and above them.

Seedream Prompt:
Low angle shot from near table level looking up at the male character from the reference portrait as he leans forward across a small round cafe table with an warm, inviting smile, his hand extended forward in a friendly gesture toward camera. The female character's hands and lower torso visible in the foreground bottom of frame reaching toward him in response. Cozy modern cafe interior with soft window light, hanging plants and warm wooden elements visible in the background above and behind the characters. Bright cheerful animation style with warm pastel colors, soft pinks and yellows. Clean modern aesthetic with expressive character design. Cinematic composition emphasizing the moment of connection.

LINE 10: Do you wanna drink coffee?
================================================================================

Korean: 커피 마실래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the final image capturing the resolution of their meeting - the coffee invitation. Unlike all previous shots which showed them sitting, talking, or close-ups of faces and gestures, this scene shows a celebratory moment from a unique aerial/bird's eye view looking straight down at the table. The camera angle is completely new (top-down), showing the full table surface with two coffee cups placed between them, and their hands reaching toward the cups in a toast-like gesture. This creates a symbolic 'agreement' visual and provides spatial context we haven't seen yet. The composition is symmetrical and intimate, focusing on the shared space and the coffee that represents their newfound friendship.

Seedream Prompt:
Bird's eye view shot looking straight down at a small round wooden cafe table from directly above. Two white ceramic coffee cups with latte art sit on the table with small spoons beside them. The male character from the reference portrait's hands are visible reaching toward one cup from the bottom of frame, wearing a casual long-sleeved shirt. The female character from the reference portrait's hands reach toward the other cup from the top of frame, wearing her characteristic outfit. Napkins, sugar packets, and a small potted succulent plant are arranged on the table between them. Warm wooden table surface with natural cafe lighting. Bright, cheerful animation style with warm pastel colors and clean modern aesthetic. Cozy, friendly atmosphere capturing the moment of agreement to share coffee together.
