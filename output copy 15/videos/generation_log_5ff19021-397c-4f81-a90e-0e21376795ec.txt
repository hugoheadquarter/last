LINE 2: I'm a bit lost
================================================================================

Korean: 길을 잃었어요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image 1 showed the initial approach moment. For this scene showing 'I'm a bit lost', I'll create a distinctly different composition by using a medium-wide side angle shot that captures the male tourist's body language of confusion and uncertainty. He'll be gesturing with his hands in a confused manner while looking at the Korean woman, who is turned toward him with an attentive, understanding expression. This creates visual variety through: 1) Different camera angle (side perspective vs frontal), 2) Full upper body visibility showing active gesturing, 3) Environmental context of a Seoul street corner with visible signage and buildings, 4) Different spatial relationship between characters - they're positioned at an angle to each other rather than face-to-face, 5) Focus on the tourist's confused body language rather than just facial expressions.

Seedream Prompt:
High-quality Korean webtoon style illustration, medium-wide side angle shot on a modern Seoul street corner. A young Hispanic male tourist in his early 20s with short dark wavy hair, warm brown eyes, light tan skin, wearing beige oversized casual blazer over white graphic t-shirt with simple geometric pattern and silver minimal chain necklace, standing with confused body language, one hand raised gesturing uncertainly, other hand holding a phone, looking toward a young Korean woman with a slightly helpless expression. The Korean woman in her early 20s with shoulder-length dark brown softly waved hair parted to the side, wearing cream-colored turtleneck sweater and long camel beige trench coat, turned toward him with attentive understanding expression, beginning to respond. Seoul street environment visible with Korean signage, modern buildings, street corner setting, crosswalk markings on ground. Clean digital illustration, soft natural colors, atmospheric urban lighting, expressive faces and body language, modern fashion, professional manhwa art style, smooth cel shading, detailed environmental context, characters filling significant frame space in unified scene.

LINE 3: Where is the station?
================================================================================

Korean: 역이 어디예요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes showed: (1) the tourist looking at his phone, likely establishing shot, and (2) a side angle medium-wide shot of their initial interaction on the street corner. For scene #3, as he asks 'Where is the station?', I'll create a distinctly different composition: a close-up frontal angle focused on the male tourist as he speaks, with the Korean woman visible in the mid-ground listening attentively. This creates visual variety through: closer framing than before, frontal perspective instead of side angle, emphasis on the male character's questioning expression and body language (perhaps gesturing or looking uncertain), and depth staging with both characters at different distances from camera. The street environment continues but from a new vantage point, showing more of the urban details behind them.

Seedream Prompt:
High-quality Korean webtoon style illustration, close-up frontal angle shot on a modern Seoul street. A young Hispanic male tourist in his early 20s with short dark wavy hair, warm brown eyes, light tan skin, wearing beige oversized casual blazer over white graphic t-shirt with simple geometric pattern and silver minimal chain necklace, stands in the foreground looking slightly uncertain with a questioning expression, one hand raised in a gentle questioning gesture near chest level. He gazes toward a young Korean woman in her early 20s with shoulder-length dark brown wavy hair parted to the side, wearing cream turtleneck sweater and long camel beige trench coat, who stands a few feet away in the mid-ground, facing him attentively with a kind listening expression. Modern Seoul street environment with storefronts, Korean signage, urban details visible in the background. Clean digital illustration with soft natural colors, smooth cel shading, clean precise linework, atmospheric lighting, expressive faces, detailed facial features, modern Seoul architecture, depth of field with foreground sharp and background slightly softer, professional manhwa art style, natural skin tones, warm afternoon light.

LINE 4: Can you help me?
================================================================================

Korean: 도와주실 수 있어요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes showed: (1) male tourist alone looking at phone, (2) medium-wide side angle of both characters meeting, (3) close-up frontal of male speaking. For Image 4 with the lyric 'Can you help me?', I'm creating a DISTINCT shift by using an over-the-shoulder perspective from BEHIND the male character, looking toward the Korean woman's face as she receives his question. This creates intimacy and puts us in the tourist's point of view. The woman is centered in frame with a warm, reassuring expression, her body language open and welcoming. This angle hasn't been used yet and provides strong visual variety through the depth of field perspective with the male's shoulder/back of head in foreground (slightly out of focus) and the woman sharp in mid-ground. The street environment shows more depth with Seoul storefronts visible behind her.

Seedream Prompt:
High-quality Korean webtoon style illustration, over-the-shoulder perspective shot on a modern Seoul street. View from behind a young Hispanic male tourist in his early 20s with short dark wavy hair, light tan skin, wearing beige oversized casual blazer over white graphic t-shirt with simple geometric pattern and silver minimal chain necklace - his right shoulder and back of head visible in foreground left side of frame, slightly out of focus. Center frame shows a young Korean woman in her early 20s facing toward him with warm welcoming smile, shoulder-length dark brown wavy hair parted to side, wearing cream turtleneck sweater and long camel beige trench coat, her gentle eyes looking at the tourist with kind helpful expression, one hand raised slightly in reassuring gesture. Background shows modern Seoul street with colorful Korean storefronts, street signs with Hangul characters, pedestrians walking past, late afternoon natural lighting creating warm atmosphere. Clean digital illustration with soft natural colors, smooth cel shading, professional manhwa art style, atmospheric depth of field, detailed urban environment, expressive faces, modern Seoul fashion, cinematic composition.

LINE 5: Go straight ahead
================================================================================

Korean: 직진하세요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes showed: (1) solo male portrait, (2) medium-wide side angle of both standing, (3) close-up frontal of male listening, (4) over-shoulder view from behind male. For scene 5 with the lyric 'Go straight ahead / 직진하세요', I'm creating a DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT composition: a dynamic wide-angle shot from a low perspective showing the Korean woman in the foreground gesturing forward down the street with her arm extended, demonstrating the 'straight ahead' direction. The Hispanic male is positioned beside/slightly behind her, both looking in the direction she's pointing. This creates depth and shows the action of giving directions. The camera angle is from ground level looking slightly up, which is completely different from all previous shots. The focus is on the gesture and the street environment stretching ahead, emphasizing the directional instruction.

Seedream Prompt:
High-quality Korean webtoon style illustration, wide-angle low perspective shot on a modern Seoul street. A young Korean woman in her early 20s with shoulder-length dark brown wavy hair parted to the side, wearing a cream turtleneck sweater and long camel beige trench coat, stands in the foreground with her right arm extended forward, pointing straight ahead down the street with confidence and a helpful smile on her face, looking in the direction she's pointing. Beside her and slightly behind, a young Hispanic male in his early 20s with short dark wavy hair, warm brown eyes, light tan skin, wearing a beige oversized casual blazer over white graphic t-shirt with geometric pattern and silver minimal chain necklace, stands looking in the same direction she's pointing with an attentive focused expression. Camera positioned low at ground level looking slightly up at the characters. Modern Seoul street stretches ahead with sidewalk, crosswalk markings, urban buildings, street signs, and trees lining the path. Bright daylight, clean digital illustration, soft natural colors, smooth cel shading, clean precise linework, atmospheric depth, professional manhwa art style, detailed environmental elements showing the straight path ahead, natural skin tones, expressive body language, dynamic composition with strong leading lines.

LINE 6: Turn left here
================================================================================

Korean: 여기서 왼쪽으로 가세요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes showed: (1) tourist alone looking at phone, (2) medium-wide side angle of initial approach, (3) close-up of tourist speaking, (4) over-shoulder view from behind tourist, (5) wide low-angle of woman explaining. For scene 6, I'm creating a DIRECTIONAL GESTURE shot - a medium close-up from a three-quarter angle showing the woman actively pointing/gesturing left with her arm extended, demonstrating the 'turn left here' instruction. The tourist is visible beside her, following her gesture with his gaze. This is visually distinct with: dynamic arm gesture as focal point, both characters in profile/three-quarter view looking at the direction she's pointing, tighter framing on upper bodies and gesture, sense of movement and instruction-giving. The camera angle captures both their faces in profile as they look toward where she's directing him.

Seedream Prompt:
High-quality Korean webtoon style illustration, medium close-up three-quarter angle shot on a modern Seoul street corner. A young Korean woman in her early 20s with shoulder-length dark brown wavy hair parted to the side, wearing cream-colored turtleneck sweater and long camel beige trench coat, is actively pointing to the left with her right arm extended, her body turned slightly in that direction, natural makeup with gentle eyes looking toward where she's pointing, friendly helpful expression. Beside her, a young Hispanic male tourist in his early 20s with short dark wavy hair, warm brown eyes, light tan skin, wearing beige oversized casual blazer over white graphic t-shirt with geometric pattern and silver minimal chain necklace, is looking in the same direction she's pointing, attentive expression, slight nod. Modern Seoul street environment with contemporary storefronts, street signs, urban architecture visible in background. Clean digital illustration, soft natural daylight, expressive faces, smooth cel shading, professional manhwa art style, atmospheric depth, detailed character features, dynamic gesture composition.

================================================================================
LINE 7: Turn right there
================================================================================

Korean: 저기서 오른쪽으로 가세요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes showed: (1) the tourist standing alone, (2) side angle of him approaching, (3) close-up of him speaking, (4) over-shoulder view from behind him, (5) low angle wide shot of the woman gesturing, (6) medium close-up of the woman giving directions. For scene 7 with the lyric 'Turn right there', I'm creating a BIRD'S EYE VIEW / HIGH ANGLE perspective looking down at both characters on the street corner. The woman is actively POINTING with her arm extended toward a specific direction (right), while the tourist is looking where she's pointing and nodding in understanding. This aerial perspective hasn't been used yet and creates visual variety by showing the full street intersection layout with directional context, making the 'turn right' instruction visually clear. Both characters are positioned at a corner with visible crosswalks and street markings below them.

Seedream Prompt:
High-quality Korean webtoon style illustration, bird's eye view high angle shot looking down at a modern Seoul street intersection corner. A young Hispanic male in his early 20s with short dark wavy hair, warm brown eyes, light tan skin, wearing beige oversized casual blazer over white graphic t-shirt with geometric pattern and silver chain necklace, stands on the left side looking down at the street corner where a young Korean woman is pointing. The Korean woman in her early 20s with shoulder-length dark brown wavy hair parted to the side, wearing cream turtleneck sweater and long camel beige trench coat, has her right arm fully extended pointing toward the right direction of the intersection. The tourist is looking at where she's pointing with engaged expression, slightly leaning forward. Visible Seoul street details below: crosswalk zebra stripes, street corner pavement tiles, manhole covers, street lane markings. Urban Seoul atmosphere with realistic street textures. Clean digital cel shading, smooth gradients, soft natural daylight from above, professional manhwa illustration quality, detailed character features, expressive body language showing directional guidance, modern casual fashion, atmospheric street environment perspective

LINE 8: It's very close
================================================================================

Korean: 아주 가까워요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene creates a distinct shift from previous shots by using an intimate close-up side profile perspective showing both characters from the side as they face each other in conversation. Unlike previous scenes that showed wider angles, over-the-shoulder views, or bird's eye perspectives, this creates a cinematic 'face-to-face' moment that emphasizes the reassuring nature of 'it's very close.' The composition places both faces in the same frame from a side angle, with the Korean woman's gentle, reassuring expression visible as she maintains eye contact with the tourist, while he looks back at her with visible relief and gratitude. The background shows soft-focused Seoul street elements between them, creating depth. This intimate framing style hasn't been used yet and perfectly captures the warmth of her reassurance.

Seedream Prompt:
High-quality Korean webtoon style illustration, intimate close-up side profile shot on a modern Seoul street. A young Hispanic male in his early 20s with short dark wavy hair, warm brown eyes, light tan skin, wearing beige oversized casual blazer over white graphic t-shirt with geometric pattern and silver chain necklace, shown in left side profile looking right with expression of visible relief and gratitude. A young Korean woman in her early 20s with shoulder-length dark brown wavy hair parted to the side, wearing cream turtleneck and camel beige trench coat, shown in right side profile looking left with warm reassuring smile and gentle encouraging expression. Both characters face each other in conversation, their faces占據 the frame with soft-focused Seoul street scene visible between them in background - modern buildings, street signs, blurred pedestrians. Natural afternoon lighting, warm atmospheric glow, clean linework, smooth cel shading, professional digital webtoon art, expressive facial details, natural skin tones, modern Seoul urban environment, cinematic intimate framing, shallow depth of field effect on background.

LINE 9: How far is it?
================================================================================

Korean: 얼마나 멀어요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes showed various angles of the conversation - side views, over-shoulder, bird's eye, and close-ups of individual reactions. Scene 8 was an intimate side profile close-up. For scene 9 with the lyric 'How far is it?', I'm creating a dramatically different composition: a wide establishing shot from a low three-quarter angle showing the Korean woman gesturing down the street toward the destination while the Hispanic man stands beside her looking in that direction. This creates a sense of distance and journey ahead. The camera pulls back to show more of the Seoul street environment - buildings, signage, the path ahead - emphasizing the question about distance. Both characters are shown in full or three-quarter body view (not just close-ups), with her arm extended pointing toward the train station direction, and him with a slightly concerned/curious expression as he gauges the distance. This is distinct from all previous scenes in its wide environmental framing and the specific gesture of pointing/showing direction.

Seedream Prompt:
High-quality Korean webtoon style illustration, wide three-quarter angle low perspective shot on a modern Seoul street corner. A young Korean woman in her early 20s with shoulder-length dark brown wavy hair parted to the side, warm friendly expression, wearing cream turtleneck sweater and long camel beige trench coat, stands on the left side with her right arm extended, pointing down the street toward the distance. Beside her on the right, a young Hispanic male in his early 20s with short dark wavy hair, warm brown eyes, light tan skin, wearing beige oversized casual blazer over white graphic t-shirt with geometric pattern and silver minimal chain necklace, looks in the direction she's pointing with slightly concerned curious expression, one hand scratching his head. Both characters shown in three-quarter to full body view. Background shows detailed modern Seoul street stretching into distance with contemporary buildings, Korean signage, street lamps, urban details, autumn afternoon lighting. Clean digital illustration, soft natural colors, expressive character animation, atmospheric depth, professional manhwa art style, detailed environmental storytelling, natural poses, realistic proportions, warm sunlight casting soft shadows.

LINE 10: About ten minutes
================================================================================

Korean: 한 십분 정도요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the final scene that brings closure to the conversation. Previous scenes showed the initial approach, the conversation exchange, hand gestures pointing directions, and close-ups of their interaction. For this finale, I'm creating a WIDE ESTABLISHING SHOT from an elevated perspective showing the tourist now confidently walking in the direction she pointed, while she remains in the foreground watching him go with a satisfied smile. This creates a natural conclusion showing the successful help given. The camera angle is a dramatic high-angle wide shot that captures the full Seoul street environment with both characters at different depths, creating a cinematic 'walking away' moment that's completely different from all previous close-ups and medium shots. The composition uses leading lines of the street to show his path forward.

Seedream Prompt:
High-quality Korean webtoon style illustration, dramatic high-angle wide establishing shot on a modern Seoul street corner during daytime. In the near foreground on the right side, a young Korean woman in her early 20s stands turned three-quarters away from camera, watching someone leave - she has shoulder-length dark brown wavy hair parted to the side, wearing cream-colored turtleneck sweater and long camel beige trench coat, gentle satisfied smile on her face as she looks down the street. In the middle distance walking away from camera down the sidewalk, a young Hispanic male in his early 20s with short dark wavy hair, light tan skin, wearing beige oversized casual blazer over white graphic t-shirt, silver minimal chain necklace visible, walking confidently with his back to camera, one hand casually in pocket. The Seoul street stretches between them with modern buildings on both sides, street signs in Korean, crosswalk markings, urban trees, soft afternoon lighting casting long shadows, atmospheric depth showing the ten-minute walk ahead. Clean digital illustration with soft natural colors, smooth cel shading, detailed urban environment, cinematic composition with depth and scale, warm lighting, expressive character posing, professional manhwa art style, wide cinematic framing showing full environment and both characters at different distances.
