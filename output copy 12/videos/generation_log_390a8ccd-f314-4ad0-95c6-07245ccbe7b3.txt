LINE 2: Your name is pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 이름이 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image 1 showed the two characters sitting across from each other at a table in a wide establishing shot. For Image 2, I'm creating a distinctly different composition with a close-up side profile view of the young woman's face as she speaks, with the young man visible but slightly out of focus in the background, creating depth. This intimate framing emphasizes the moment she says his name is pretty, focusing on her warm expression and the personal nature of the compliment. The camera angle is completely different - a profile close-up rather than a wide two-shot - and the staging shows her leaning slightly forward in an engaged, friendly manner while he listens attentively in the background.

Seedream Prompt:
Close-up side profile view of a young woman with long black hair in a ponytail, wearing a cream-colored cardigan, speaking with a gentle smile on her face. She is leaning slightly forward in an engaged, friendly manner. In the soft-focus background, a young man with short dark hair wearing a light blue button-up shirt is visible, listening attentively. Warm cafe interior with blurred bokeh lights, potted plants, and wooden furniture in the background. Soft pastel color palette with peach and mint green tones, warm golden lighting from cafe windows. Korean webtoon illustration style with clean line art, bright and welcoming atmosphere, intimate conversational moment.

LINE 3: How old are you

Korean: 몇살이에요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1 and 2 showed the wide cafe establishing shot and a close-up side profile of the woman speaking. To create distinct variety for the age question, I'm switching to focus on the YOUNG MAN's reaction/response. This will be a medium-close shot from a slightly different angle (frontal-diagonal rather than pure side profile), showing him responding to her question with a friendly smile. The woman will be visible in partial frame (shoulder/back of head) to maintain the conversation dynamic. This gives us character-switching focus, different camera angle, and shows his engagement in the dialogue - creating clear visual progression from her asking to him responding.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium-close shot of a young Asian man with short dark brown hair and casual navy blue shirt, sitting at a cafe table, looking slightly to his left with a friendly, warm smile as he responds to a question. His body language is open and engaged, hands gesturing naturally near a coffee cup on the wooden table. In the foreground/side of frame, partially visible is the back of a young woman's head with long black hair in a ponytail and cream cardigan, indicating she's listening to him. Warm cafe environment with soft natural lighting from windows, blurred background showing cafe plants and warm wooden interior details. Warm, friendly animated illustration style with soft pastel colors, clean line art with modern Korean webtoon aesthetic.

LINE 4: You look so young
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 어려보여요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene shifts dramatically from the previous close-up shots. Instead of individual portraits or seated conversation, I'm creating an over-the-shoulder perspective from the woman's viewpoint, looking AT the young man as she observes him. This creates intimacy and matches the lyric 'You look so young' - we're seeing him through her eyes. The camera angle is completely different (POV-style from behind her), and we see more of the cafe environment including the window, plants, and ambient cafe details. The man is shown in a more candid, natural moment - perhaps slightly bashful or curious about her attention, which differs from his previous listening expression.

Seedream Prompt:
Over-the-shoulder perspective shot from behind a young woman with long black hair in a ponytail wearing a cream-colored cardigan, looking across a cafe table at a young Asian man with short dark brown hair wearing a navy blue casual shirt. The man sits facing the camera with a slightly shy, curious smile, one hand near his coffee cup. The cafe setting is visible with a large window behind him showing soft daylight, indoor plants on the windowsill, warm wooden furniture, and other cafe details like pastries on a nearby counter. Warm afternoon lighting filters through the window. The composition emphasizes the woman's perspective of observing the man, with her shoulder and side of her head visible in the foreground. Soft pastel color palette with peach, mint green, and soft yellow tones. Modern Korean webtoon illustration style with clean lines and warm, friendly atmosphere.

LINE 5: What is your hobby
================================================================================

Korean: 취미가 뭐예요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes have shown: 1) Wide two-shot across table, 2) Close-up side profile of woman speaking, 3) Medium-close of man responding, 4) Over-shoulder from woman's perspective. For image 5, I'll create a dynamic NEW ANGLE: a wide shot from the SIDE of the table showing both characters in profile/three-quarter view engaged in animated conversation. The woman is leaning forward slightly with an enthusiastic gesture (perhaps hand raised in an expressive motion asking about hobbies), while the man is responding with interest. This side angle shows the full cafe environment around them - other tables, window light, plants - giving environmental context we haven't fully seen yet. The framing captures their body language and the casual, friendly energy of the conversation from a fresh perspective that feels like a natural progression of their dialogue.

Seedream Prompt:
Wide side angle shot of a young Asian woman with long black hair in a ponytail wearing a cream-colored cardigan sitting at a small round wooden cafe table across from a young Asian man with short dark brown hair wearing a casual navy blue shirt. The woman is leaning forward slightly with an animated, friendly expression, her hand raised in a natural conversational gesture as she asks a question. The man is turned toward her with an engaged, interested expression. Two coffee cups and a small potted succulent are on the table between them. The cafe setting shows warm afternoon sunlight streaming through large windows, other cafe tables and chairs visible in the soft-focus background, hanging plants, and wooden furniture. Warm, friendly animated illustration style with soft pastel colors (peach, mint green, soft yellow), clean line art with modern Korean webtoon aesthetic, bright and welcoming mood

LINE 6: I like it too
================================================================================

Korean: 저도 좋아해요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene breaks away from all previous shots by showing a genuine moment of shared joy and connection. Unlike the previous formal sitting positions and conversation angles, this will be a close-up dual shot capturing both characters' faces simultaneously as they share a laugh or smile about their common interest. The camera angle will be a frontal medium-close shot showing both their faces side-by-side in the same frame, creating an intimate moment of connection. Their body language will be more relaxed and animated, leaning slightly toward each other. The background will show the blurred cafe environment with warm bokeh lights and soft green plant foliage, creating depth while keeping focus on their genuine expressions of mutual interest.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium-close frontal shot of a young Asian woman with long black hair in a ponytail wearing a cream-colored cardigan on the left side and a young Asian man with short dark brown hair wearing a navy blue shirt on the right side, both sitting at a cafe table, their faces visible in the same frame showing genuine warm smiles and friendly expressions as they share a moment of connection over their common interest, the woman's eyes bright and engaged, the man looking relaxed and happy, blurred cafe background with warm golden bokeh lights and soft green plant foliage creating depth, coffee cups visible on the wooden table surface between them, warm pastel color palette with peach and mint green tones, soft natural lighting creating a cozy intimate atmosphere, modern Korean webtoon illustration style with clean lines and gentle shading

LINE 7: Where did you get that clothe
================================================================================

Korean: 그 옷 어디서 샀어요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene breaks from previous shots by introducing a new focal point - the man's clothing. Unlike previous scenes showing conversational exchanges from various angles, this shot focuses on the woman's playful gesture of touching or pointing at the man's navy blue shirt, creating a more tactile, interactive moment. The camera angle shifts to a close-up diagonal perspective capturing both characters in a tighter frame with emphasis on the shirt detail. This creates intimacy and playfulness different from the wider conversation shots before. The woman leans forward more actively, while the man looks slightly surprised/flattered, adding dynamic body language we haven't seen yet.

Seedream Prompt:
Close-up diagonal angle shot in a cozy cafe setting showing a young Asian woman with long black hair in a ponytail wearing a cream-colored cardigan leaning forward slightly across a small table, her hand gesturing toward or lightly touching the fabric of a young Asian man's navy blue casual shirt. The man with short dark brown hair sits with a surprised but pleased expression, looking down at his shirt then back at her with a shy smile. Visible cafe details include coffee cups on the wooden table between them, soft warm lighting, and blurred background with hanging plants and cafe shelves. Warm, friendly animated illustration style with soft pastel colors (peach, mint green, soft yellow), clean line art with modern Korean webtoon aesthetic, bright and welcoming casual atmosphere

LINE 8: It's so pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene breaks from the previous seated conversation shots by creating a REACTION MOMENT. Instead of the standard across-table framing we've been using, this shows the WOMAN'S PERSPECTIVE looking down at herself - a self-aware, slightly bashful moment where she processes his compliment. The camera angle is unique: a HIGH ANGLE shot looking down at her hands nervously fidgeting with her coffee cup, with her face tilted down showing a shy, pleased smile. The man is visible in soft focus across the table in the background, creating depth. This is completely different from: Image 1 (wide establishing), Image 2 (her side profile speaking), Image 3 (his response), Image 4 (over-shoulder), Image 5 (wide side angle), Image 6 (her frontal medium-close), and Image 7 (close diagonal of both). This gives us a vulnerable, introspective beat that matches the lyric 'It's so pretty' - she's feeling a bit self-conscious but happy about the connection.

Seedream Prompt:
High angle downward shot in a cozy cafe setting, looking down at a young Asian woman with long black hair in a ponytail wearing a cream-colored cardigan, her face tilted slightly downward with a shy pleased smile and slight blush on her cheeks, her hands delicately holding a white ceramic coffee cup on a small round wooden table, the young Asian man with short dark brown hair in navy blue shirt visible in soft focus sitting across from her in the background, warm cafe lighting with potted plants and coffee shop details around them, gentle afternoon sunlight streaming through windows, warm pastel color palette with peach and mint green tones, Korean webtoon illustration style with clean lines and soft shading, intimate and tender mood

LINE 9: Do you want to be friends?
================================================================================

Korean: 우리 친구할래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene marks a pivotal moment - the woman is directly asking to be friends. Unlike previous images that focused on conversation, expressions, and coffee cups, this image will show a moment of hopeful anticipation. I'm creating a LOW ANGLE shot looking UP at the young woman as she leans forward slightly with an inviting, friendly smile and open body language, her hand perhaps gesturing welcomingly. This upward perspective makes her appear warm and approachable, emphasizing the invitation. The cafe environment is visible behind her with soft bokeh lights and plants. This angle and composition is completely different from all previous shots - we haven't used a low angle perspective yet, and it captures the emotional beat of extending friendship.

Seedream Prompt:
Low angle shot looking upward at a young Asian woman with long black hair in a ponytail wearing a cream-colored cardigan, leaning forward slightly over a cafe table with a warm, inviting smile on her face, one hand extended in a welcoming gesture toward the camera. Her expression is friendly and hopeful. The background shows a cozy cafe interior with soft bokeh lights, hanging plants, and warm peachy-orange tones. A coffee cup sits on the wooden table in the lower foreground. The perspective makes her appear warm and approachable. Across from her, partially visible in the lower frame, is the back of a young Asian man's head and shoulder in a navy blue shirt. Warm, friendly animated illustration style with soft pastel colors, clean line art, modern Korean webtoon aesthetic, bright welcoming mood.

LINE 10: Do you wanna drink coffee?

Korean: 커피 마실래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the final scene showing the conclusion of their friendly interaction. To make it distinctly different from all previous shots, I'm creating a wide two-shot composition showing BOTH characters standing up from their table, ready to continue their coffee friendship elsewhere. The camera pulls back to show more of the cafe environment around them - the full table with coffee cups, surrounding cafe furniture, plants, and warm lighting fixtures. Previous scenes focused heavily on seated conversation and individual reactions; this finale shows them both in full-body or three-quarter view, capturing the energy of a positive outcome as they prepare to leave together or continue their conversation. The body language is open and friendly - perhaps both smiling, one gesturing toward the door or another part of the cafe. This creates a sense of completion and forward movement that distinguishes it from the intimate seated conversations of images 1-9.

Seedream Prompt:
Wide establishing shot of a cozy cafe interior showing a young Asian woman with long black hair in a ponytail wearing a cream-colored cardigan and a young Asian man with short dark brown hair wearing a casual navy blue shirt, both standing or half-standing from their small round wooden table, smiling warmly at each other in a friendly manner. The scene captures both full figures or three-quarter body shots showing their complete interaction. The wooden table between them has two coffee cups, small potted succulent plants, and cafe items. Surrounding them is the warm cafe environment with hanging pendant lights, wall shelves with plants, other empty wooden tables and chairs, and large windows letting in natural light. Warm pastel color palette with peach, mint green, and soft yellow tones. Clean line art style with modern Korean webtoon aesthetic, bright and welcoming atmosphere showing the positive conclusion of their friendly coffee conversation.
