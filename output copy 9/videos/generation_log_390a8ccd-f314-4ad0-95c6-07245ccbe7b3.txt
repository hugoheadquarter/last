LINE 2: Your name is pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 이름이 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image #1 showed the woman approaching the man from a distance in the cafe. For image #2, I need to create visual distinction by changing the camera angle and proximity. Since the lyric focuses on the compliment about his name, I'll show a closer, more intimate perspective - a medium shot showing both characters now seated or standing closer together at a cafe table, with the woman leaning in slightly as she speaks. The camera angle will be from the side, capturing both their profiles/three-quarter views as they engage in conversation. The real environment (cafe interior) remains visible with tables, chairs, windows, and warm lighting in the background, but the framing is tighter on the characters to emphasize the personal connection forming. This is compositionally different because: closer proximity between characters, different camera angle (side view vs approach), tighter framing, and both characters now actively engaged rather than one approaching.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright, friendly animated style with warm pastel colors. Medium shot from the side showing a young woman with shoulder-length brown hair and a young man with short dark hair sitting together at a small cafe table, engaged in friendly conversation. The woman is leaning in slightly with a warm smile, gesturing as she speaks. The man faces her with an attentive, pleasant expression. Both characters fill significant frame space in a unified composition. Real cafe interior environment visible behind them with wooden tables, chairs, soft window lighting, and cozy decor details. Warm, welcoming atmosphere with soft pinks, yellows, and light blues. Clean, modern aesthetic with expressive character faces showing friendliness and connection.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-0
Selected indices: [0]
Reasoning:
Image 0 shows both characters clearly visible in a cafe setting with straightforward framing - the woman approaching and the man at the table. This provides good style reference (character designs, cafe environment, warm lighting) without problematic compositional elements like over-shoulder shots, POV angles, or foreground obstructions. Since there's only one previous image and it matches the character count (2 people) and setting requirements, selecting just this single reference is safest to avoid compositional reinforcement while providing consistent style guidance.

LINE 3: How old are you
================================================================================

Korean: 몇살이에요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1 and 2 showed the approach and initial greeting from side angles. For image 3, I'll create a distinctly different composition by using a closer shot focused on the woman's face as she asks the question, with the man visible in the mid-ground responding. This creates visual variety through different camera proximity and depth. The real cafe environment includes visible tables with coffee cups, chairs, warm pendant lighting fixtures, potted plants on shelves, and wooden elements to establish the cozy setting. The composition is unified with both characters in the same continuous space, not split-screen.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright, friendly animated style with warm pastel colors. Close-up shot from a slightly angled perspective showing a young woman with shoulder-length brown hair in the foreground, her face turned toward camera with a curious, friendly expression as she asks a question. A young man with short dark hair is visible in the mid-ground behind her, responding with a gentle smile. Real cozy cafe interior surrounds them with wooden tables bearing ceramic coffee cups, warm hanging pendant lights glowing softly above, potted green plants on wall shelves, comfortable chairs, and soft natural light from windows. Characters are in the same unified space having a natural conversation. Clean modern aesthetic with expressive faces conveying warmth and friendliness.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-1
Selected indices: [1]
Reasoning:
Image 1 is a medium side shot showing both characters clearly visible at a cafe table - a clean, straightforward composition that provides the bright animated style and warm pastel colors without problematic framing elements. Image 0 is excluded because while it shows the woman 'approaching' the man, this could create compositional copying issues if it features the woman standing/walking toward a seated man, which doesn't match the current lyric's simpler conversational moment. Since we only have 2 previous images and both are recent, selecting just Image 1 is the safest approach - it provides the needed style reference (animated, warm, cafe setting, 2 characters) with minimal risk of compositional interference.

================================================================================
LINE 4: You look so young
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 어려보여요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1-3 showed the approaching woman and the seated man from various angles (approach, side medium shot, close-up). For image #4, I need a distinctly different composition while showing the woman commenting on his youthful appearance. This calls for a different camera angle - perhaps from behind the woman's shoulder looking at the man's face as she observes him, or a wider two-shot showing their body language. The real cafe environment needs to be visible with specific details like the table between them, coffee cups, cafe furniture, and warm lighting. This is compositionally different because it captures the moment of observation/compliment with a new perspective that emphasizes her looking at him thoughtfully.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright, friendly animated style with warm pastel colors. Medium wide shot from a three-quarter angle showing a young woman with shoulder-length brown hair sitting across a small cafe table from a young man with short dark hair. She is leaning forward slightly with an observant, friendly expression, gesturing gently as she speaks to him. He sits relaxed with a shy smile. Between them on the wooden table are two coffee cups. The cozy cafe environment is visible around them with other tables, chairs, potted plants, and warm pendant lighting hanging from the ceiling. Soft natural light comes through windows in the background. Clean modern aesthetic with expressive character designs showing a friendly conversation moment.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-2
Selected indices: [1]
Reasoning:
Image 1 is the safest choice as it shows a medium shot from the side with both characters clearly visible at a cafe table - a simple, clean composition that matches the 2-person scene requirement. Images 0 and 2 are too similar to Image 1 in their cafe table setup, and selecting all three would create compositional reinforcement of the same framing (woman and man at cafe table). Since all previous images share very similar compositions (cafe table conversation), selecting only one reference provides the style elements (warm pastels, friendly animated style, character designs) while minimizing the risk of Seedream copying the repetitive cafe-table-conversation framing yet again. This allows more flexibility for the current lyric's focus on 'looking young' while maintaining stylistic consistency.

LINE 5: What is your hobby
================================================================================

Korean: 취미가 뭐예요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This image shifts to a new angle - an over-the-shoulder shot from behind the young man, looking at the young woman as she asks her question. This is compositionally different from previous images which showed side views, angled perspectives, and the woman approaching. The real cafe environment is visible with wooden tables, coffee cups, chairs, and warm lighting fixtures in the background. The focus is on the woman's curious, engaged expression as she leans forward slightly, asking about his hobbies, while we see the back of the man's head and shoulder in the foreground, creating depth and intimacy in the conversation.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright, friendly animated style with warm pastel colors. Over-the-shoulder shot from behind a young man with short dark hair, looking at a young woman with shoulder-length brown hair and a warm, curious smile sitting across from him at a wooden cafe table. The woman is leaning forward slightly with an engaged, friendly expression, asking a question. Coffee cups and a small plant on the table between them. Cozy cafe interior visible in background with warm pendant lighting, wooden chairs, and soft natural light through windows. Clean, modern aesthetic with expressive character animation style. The scene captures an intimate conversational moment with the woman as the focal point.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-3
Selected indices: [1, 3]
Reasoning:
Images 1 and 3 both feature clear medium/medium-wide shots showing both characters clearly visible without problematic compositional elements like over-shoulder shots, backs in foreground, or POV angles. Image 1 provides a side angle with both characters at the cafe table, while Image 3 offers a three-quarter angle view - both give clean, straightforward framing that will provide style guidance (art style, colors, character designs) without forcing Seedream to copy complex layered compositions. Image 0 and 2 descriptions are incomplete/cut off, making them risky choices. Selecting just 2 references keeps it safe while maintaining compositional diversity between the side and three-quarter angles.

================================================================================
LINE 6: I like it too
================================================================================

Korean: 저도 좋아해요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1-5 have shown various angles of the conversation, including approaches, side views, close-ups, and over-the-shoulder shots. For image 6, with the lyric 'I like it too,' this suggests shared interest and agreement. To create visual distinction, I'll use a medium two-shot from a frontal angle showing both characters sitting at the cafe table together, with the woman responding enthusiastically to something the man said. The camera will be positioned at eye level across from them, showing their rapport building. The real cafe environment will include the wooden table between them, coffee cups, the window behind them, and other cafe details like chairs and decor. This is compositionally different because it's a straight-on two-shot rather than the side angles, close-ups, or over-shoulder views we've used before, and it emphasizes their growing connection through their positioning at the table together.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright, friendly animated style with warm pastel colors. Medium frontal two-shot at eye level showing a young woman with shoulder-length brown hair and a young man with short dark hair sitting together at a wooden cafe table. The woman is gesturing animatedly with an enthusiastic, agreeable expression, while the man smiles back warmly. Both are positioned on opposite sides of the table with coffee cups between them. Real cafe environment with window lighting behind them, chairs, hanging lights, and soft bokeh cafe details in the background. Warm, inviting atmosphere showing their friendly connection building. Clean, modern aesthetic with expressive character faces conveying shared interest and rapport.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-4
Selected indices: [1, 3]
Reasoning:
Image 1 provides a clean medium side shot with both characters clearly visible at a cafe table - straightforward composition that won't create duplicates. Image 3 offers a medium wide shot from a three-quarter angle with both characters visible in the cafe setting - also compositionally simple. I'm avoiding Image 4 (over-the-shoulder shot from behind the man - high risk of copying that exact framing and creating duplicate characters). Images 0 and 2 are older and we have better recent options. Selecting only 2 references keeps compositional reinforcement minimal while providing consistent style reference for the warm, friendly cafe interaction.

LINE 7: Where did you get that clothe
================================================================================

Korean: 그 옷 어디서 샀어요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This image focuses on the male character's clothing, specifically his shirt/outfit, as the female asks where he got it. To make this compositionally different from previous shots (which showed frontal conversations and over-shoulder angles), I'll use a medium-close shot angled from the side/three-quarter view, focusing more prominently on the male character's upper body and his clothing while the female leans in with interest from the side, examining or gesturing toward his outfit. The cafe environment remains visible with tables, chairs, warm lighting, and cafe details like cups or pastries on nearby tables to maintain the real setting.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright, friendly animated style with warm pastel colors. Medium-close side angle shot in a cozy cafe showing a young man with short dark hair wearing a stylish casual shirt, with a young woman with shoulder-length brown hair leaning toward him from the side with an interested, admiring expression, gesturing or looking at his clothing. Both characters prominently featured with the male character's outfit clearly visible. Cafe interior background with wooden tables, chairs, coffee cups, warm pendant lighting, and cafe details. Clean modern aesthetic, expressive friendly faces, cheerful welcoming mood, soft pinks yellows and light blues color palette.

REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-5
Selected indices: [1, 3, 5]
Reasoning:
Image 1 is a simple medium side shot with both characters clearly visible at the table - clean composition. Image 3 is a medium wide three-quarter angle shot showing both characters without obstructive framing. Image 5 is a straightforward frontal two-shot at eye level with both characters visible. All three have 2 people matching the scene requirement. Image 0 is too vague. Image 2 (close-up) might be too tight for a clothing compliment scene. Image 4 is explicitly over-the-shoulder from behind the man - this would cause Seedream to copy that problematic framing and create duplicate characters. These three selected images provide diverse angles (side, three-quarter, frontal) while maintaining simple, clean compositions in the cafe setting.

LINE 8: It's so pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image 7 was a medium-close side angle shot of the male character. For image 8, I need a clearly different composition that shows 'pretty' being admired. Since the lyric is about something being pretty (likely referring to his clothing as mentioned in story context), I'll create a medium shot from a frontal angle showing the woman looking admiringly at the man's outfit, with her hand gesturing toward his clothing. This is compositionally different with a new angle and both characters visible. The real environment is the cozy cafe with visible tables, chairs, wooden floor, and warm pendant lighting in the background, showing depth and atmosphere.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright, friendly animated style with warm pastel colors. Medium frontal shot at a slight high angle in a cozy cafe showing a young woman with shoulder-length brown hair and warm smile gesturing admiringly with her hand toward a young man with short dark hair wearing a casual button-up shirt. She has an impressed, complimentary expression on her face. The man stands confidently. Real cafe environment visible behind them with wooden tables, chairs, potted plants, warm pendant lights hanging from ceiling, and soft natural light from windows. Clean modern aesthetic with expressive character faces conveying admiration and appreciation. Both characters prominently featured in the same unified space.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-6
Selected indices: [1, 3, 5]
Reasoning:
These three images provide clean style references without problematic compositions:

Image 1: Medium side shot with both characters clearly visible at the cafe table - straightforward framing with no foreground obstruction.

Image 3: Medium wide shot from three-quarter angle showing both characters in the cafe environment - clean composition with both people fully visible.

Image 5: Medium frontal two-shot at eye level - simple, direct framing with both characters clearly shown.

Avoided:
- Image 4: Over-the-shoulder shot from behind the man - this would cause Seedream to copy the 'person's back in foreground' composition
- Image 6: Side angle shot focusing on one character - less relevant for a two-person interaction scene

These three selections are compositionally diverse (side, three-quarter, frontal) while all maintaining clean, simple framing that won't cause duplicate character issues. They match the 2-person character count and provide consistent warm, friendly animated style.

LINE 9: Do you want to be friends?
================================================================================

Korean: 우리 친구할래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is image 9 of 10, marking the friendship proposal moment. To make it compositionally distinct from previous images (which included medium shots, over-shoulder, and frontal angles), I'll create a LOW ANGLE shot looking slightly upward at both characters. They'll be standing close together in the cafe, with the woman gesturing welcomingly with an open hand extended toward the man, suggesting friendship. The camera angle will be from below eye level, showing them against the cafe's upper details (lights, ceiling elements, upper shelves). This low angle creates a sense of warmth and openness, emphasizing the friendly invitation. The real environment is the cozy cafe with visible tables, chairs, pendant lights, and wall decorations in the background. Both characters are positioned naturally in the same unified space, with warm cafe lighting creating a welcoming atmosphere.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright, friendly animated style with warm pastel colors. Low angle shot from below looking slightly upward in a cozy cafe showing a young woman with shoulder-length brown hair and a warm smile standing close to a young man with short dark hair. She is extending her hand in a welcoming gesture toward him, suggesting friendship. He looks interested and pleased. Both characters are in casual clothing, positioned naturally in the same space. Background shows cafe details above them including pendant lights, ceiling elements, shelves with cups and decorations, wooden tables and chairs visible at the edges. Warm yellow lighting creates an inviting atmosphere. Clean, modern aesthetic with expressive faces conveying friendliness and openness. Characters fill significant frame space in a unified composition.

REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-7
Selected indices: [1, 3, 5]
Reasoning:
These three images provide strong style references without problematic compositions. Image 1 (medium side shot) and Image 5 (medium frontal two-shot) both show both characters clearly visible in straightforward framing with no backs or foreground elements. Image 3 (medium wide shot from three-quarter angle) adds compositional diversity while maintaining clean visibility of both characters. All three feature the cozy cafe environment and warm pastel color palette needed for style consistency. I'm avoiding Image 4 (over-the-shoulder shot) as it risks copying the behind-character framing, and Image 6 which focuses on the male character alone. Images 1, 3, and 5 are compositionally diverse enough to avoid reinforcement while all being safe, clean two-person shots.

LINE 10: Do you wanna drink coffee?
================================================================================

Korean: 커피 마실래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the final image of the sequence, marking the conclusion of the coffee invitation. To make it visually distinct from image 9 (low angle of woman with cupped hands gesture), I'll create a wide establishing shot that shows both characters now sitting together at a cafe table with two coffee cups between them, symbolizing the acceptance of her invitation. This shifts from standing conversation to seated interaction, showing the relationship has progressed. The camera pulls back to a medium-wide shot at eye level, capturing the cozy cafe environment around them with warm lighting, other tables, and cafe details visible. Both characters are shown in profile/three-quarter view facing each other across the table, creating a sense of connection and friendship established. This composition is completely different - it's wider, shows both seated, includes the table as a central element, and emphasizes the cafe setting more prominently than previous images.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright, friendly animated style with warm pastel colors. Medium-wide eye-level shot in a cozy cafe interior showing a young woman with shoulder-length brown hair and a young man with short dark hair sitting together at a small round wooden table. Two steaming coffee cups sit on the table between them. The woman and man are facing each other in three-quarter profile view, both smiling warmly in friendly conversation. The cafe environment is visible around them with warm pendant lighting overhead, other tables and chairs in soft focus in the background, potted plants, and a window showing soft daylight. Warm peachy and cream tones throughout the cafe with touches of soft yellow lighting. Both characters are relaxed and engaged, showing the beginning of a new friendship. Clean, modern aesthetic with expressive character designs.

All three avoid over-shoulder, POV, or 'person's back' compositions that would cause Seedream to duplicate characters. They provide consistent style reference (bright animated style, warm pastels, character designs) while maintaining simple, straightforward framing. I'm avoiding Image 4 (over-shoulder from behind the man) and focusing on compositionally diverse but clean shots from the set.
