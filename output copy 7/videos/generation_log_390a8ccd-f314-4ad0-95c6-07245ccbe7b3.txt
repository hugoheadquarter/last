LINE 2: Your name is pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 이름이 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image 1 showed both people at the cafe table from waist up in a close-up view. For Image 2, I'm creating compositional variety by zooming in much tighter on just ONE person's face as they react warmly to hearing the other's name. This is a reaction shot focusing on facial expression and emotion, rather than showing both people together. The camera angle is straight-on/slightly low looking at the speaker's delighted face, creating an intimate moment that captures the warmth of the compliment. This gives us visual variety: Image 1 = both people, medium shot; Image 2 = single person, close-up reaction shot.

Seedream Prompt:
Close-up view of a young Korean person with short bob haircut, face filling most of the frame, looking slightly to the side with a warm, genuine smile and bright sparkling eyes showing delight. Soft natural lighting from a cafe window illuminating their face. Bright friendly flat illustration style with pastel colors, clean lines. Blurred soft bokeh background suggesting cafe interior with warm yellows and mint greens. The person's expression radiates genuine happiness and friendliness, as if paying a sincere compliment. Warm and inviting mood with soft pink and peach tones in the lighting.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-0
Selected indices: [0]
Reasoning:
Selecting only Image 0 because it matches the 2-person character count and provides the cafe setting style we need. The close-up, waist-up framing showing both people clearly is compositionally safe - no backs, no over-shoulder shots, no POV angles that would cause duplication issues. Since we only have one previous image described and it fits our needs without problematic composition, using just this single reference is the safest approach to avoid reinforcing any unwanted compositional elements while maintaining visual continuity for the story.

================================================================================
LINE 3: How old are you
================================================================================

Korean: 몇살이에요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1 and 2 showed the two friends at the cafe table from waist-up and then a close-up of one person's face. For image 3, which asks 'How old are you?', I'm creating a completely different composition: a wide shot showing both people seated at the cafe table from a side perspective, capturing more of the environment and their body language during this question-and-answer moment. This pulls back to show context - the full cafe setting with their coffee cups, pastries, and the warm atmosphere around them. The camera angle is now from the side at table level, showing both people in profile or three-quarter view as they engage in conversation, which is distinctly different from the previous close-up shots.

Seedream Prompt:
Wide side view of two young Korean friends sitting across from each other at a small round cafe table, both visible in full seated position from a side angle at table height. One person has short bob haircut wearing pastel pink top, the other has shoulder-length hair in loose waves wearing mint green cardigan. Coffee cups and small pastries on the table between them. Bright modern Korean cafe interior with plants and soft natural lighting through windows. Warm, friendly atmosphere. Flat illustration style with pastel colors - soft pinks, mint greens, warm yellows, sky blues. Clean lines, playful hand-drawn aesthetic, inviting mood.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-1
Selected indices: [1]
Reasoning:
Image 1 is a close-up of a single person's face with straightforward framing - perfect for providing style (facial features, warm expression, lighting) without compositional interference. Image 0 is risky because it shows 'two people at a cafe table from waist up' which could cause Seedream to copy that exact composition when we need fresh framing for the 'how old are you' question moment. Since we only have 2 previous images and one is problematic, selecting just the safe close-up portrait minimizes compositional copying while maintaining character style consistency.

================================================================================
LINE 4: You look so young
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 어려보여요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1-3 have shown: (1) waist-up close view of both people at table, (2) extreme close-up of one person's face, (3) wide side view of both at table. For image 4, the lyric 'You look so young' suggests one person observing/complimenting the other. To create visual distinction, I'll use an ANGLED TOP-DOWN perspective looking down at the table from above, showing both people from overhead - their coffee cups, hands on table, and the tops of their heads visible. This bird's-eye view is completely different from the previous straight-on, close-up face, and side-view compositions. It shows the intimate cafe setting from a fresh angle while keeping both characters present since one is commenting on the other.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright friendly flat illustration in pastel colors, angled top-down bird's eye view looking down at a small round cafe table from above, two young Korean friends sitting across from each other visible from overhead showing tops of their heads, one with short bob haircut and one with longer hair, coffee cups and pastries on the table between them, their hands resting on the table surface, warm yellow and soft pink tones, clean modern Korean cafe aesthetic with playful hand-drawn style, mint green accents, cozy and inviting atmosphere


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-2
Selected indices: [1]
Reasoning:
Image 1 is a close-up of a single person's face with a warm smile - this provides excellent style reference (art style, facial features, warm expression) without compositional risks. Images 0 and 2 both show two people at a cafe table, which could cause Seedream to reinforce the same cafe table composition we've already used multiple times. Since all available images show similar cafe/conversation settings, selecting only the single-person close-up minimizes compositional copying while still providing the warm, friendly aesthetic needed for the 'you look so young' compliment line. The close-up facial reference will help capture the intimate moment of giving a compliment without forcing Seedream to repeat the two-people-at-table composition again.

================================================================================
LINE 5: What is your hobby
================================================================================

Korean: 취미가 뭐예요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1-4 have shown: waist-up of both people, close-up of one face, wide side view of both at table, and bird's eye view looking down at the table. For image 5, I need something completely different. Since the lyric asks 'What is your hobby?', I'll create a close-up focus on HANDS in motion - showing one person's hands gesturing expressively while talking about hobbies. This is a detail shot we haven't seen yet, focusing on body language rather than faces or full scene. The hands could be animated mid-gesture over the table surface with coffee cups partially visible, creating an intimate moment that captures the enthusiasm of sharing interests. This gives us a fresh perspective: tight crop on hands/table surface rather than faces or full bodies.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright friendly flat illustration in pastel colors, close-up detail shot of hands gesturing expressively over a cafe table surface, one person's hands animated mid-conversation gesture explaining their hobbies, warm skin tones, fingernails with subtle polish, delicate silver rings, coffee cups partially visible at edges of frame, smooth wooden table texture in soft warm brown, scattered cafe items like napkin and sugar packets, shallow depth of field effect with background softly blurred in mint green and soft pink tones, warm natural lighting, cozy intimate atmosphere, focus on the expressive hand movement and body language of enthusiastic conversation


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-3
Selected indices: [3]
Reasoning:
Image 3 is the safest choice - it's a bird's eye view showing both people clearly at a table, which provides excellent style reference (bright friendly flat illustration, pastel colors) without risky compositional elements like over-shoulder shots or backs in foreground. The top-down angle is distinctive enough that it won't cause boring repetition, yet simple enough to let the new prompt guide the composition. Images 0 and 2 both show two people at a cafe table from similar angles, which would reinforce cafe table framing too strongly. Image 1 is a close-up of one person, which doesn't match the 2-person scene requirement. Selecting only image 3 keeps it safe and focused on style transfer while allowing compositional flexibility for the new lyric about hobbies.

LINE 6: I like it too
================================================================================

Korean: 저도 좋아해요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous images showed: #1 waist-up two people, #2 close-up single face, #3 wide side view of both at table, #4 overhead bird's eye view, #5 close-up of hands. For 'I like it too' showing mutual enthusiasm and agreement, I'll create a SPLIT SCREEN composition - vertically dividing the frame to show both characters simultaneously in their own panel, each reacting with excited agreement. This creates visual symmetry and equality, showing mirrored enthusiasm. This is completely different from all previous angles - it's a graphic design choice rather than a camera angle, showing both faces clearly but in a stylized dual-panel format.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright friendly flat illustration in pastel colors, split screen composition with vertical divider line down the center of the frame, left panel shows young Korean person with short bob haircut smiling warmly with eyes sparkling, right panel shows young Korean person with shoulder-length hair smiling back with equal enthusiasm, both shown from shoulders up in matching close-up framing, soft pink background on left side, mint green background on right side, clean geometric split creating perfect symmetry, modern Korean cafe aesthetic, playful and warm mood showing mutual agreement and excitement, pastel color palette with soft pinks mint greens and warm yellows


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-4
Selected indices: [1, 3]
Reasoning:
Image 1 is a close-up of a single person's face with a warm smile - simple, clean composition that provides excellent style reference for facial expressions and warmth without risk of copying problematic framing. Image 3 is a bird's eye view of the cafe table with both people visible from above - this provides good style, color palette, and character design reference while having a unique enough composition (top-down) that won't interfere with whatever shot angle is needed for the current lyric. Avoiding Image 0 and 2 as they show standard seated cafe angles which could cause repetition. Avoiding Image 4 as it's a detail shot of hands that might cause Seedream to focus too much on hands/gestures. Using only 2 references to minimize compositional reinforcement.

LINE 7: Where did you get that clothe
================================================================================

Korean: 그 옷 어디서 샀어요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This image needs to focus on the fashion/clothing element mentioned in the lyric. Previous images showed: (1) waist-up cafe meeting, (2) close-up face, (3) wide side view of table, (4) bird's eye view of table, (5) hands over table, (6) split screen faces. For image 7, I'll create a unique composition focusing on the clothing itself - a medium shot from a three-quarter angle showing one person gesturing admiringly toward the other person's outfit. This shifts focus from faces/table to the actual garment being complimented, while keeping both characters visible to maintain the conversation flow. The camera angle will be slightly elevated, looking down at about 30 degrees to capture both the pointing gesture and the clothing details clearly.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright friendly flat illustration in pastel colors, medium three-quarter angle view slightly elevated looking down at two young Korean friends in a modern cafe, one person on the left gesturing with an open hand toward the other person's stylish outfit on the right, the person being complimented is wearing a distinctive pastel pink cardigan with decorative buttons, both people are smiling warmly, soft mint green and cream colored cafe interior background with potted plants, warm yellow lighting, clean modern Korean aesthetic, playful hand-drawn style, inviting atmosphere with sky blue and peach accents, focus on the clothing and friendly admiring gesture


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-5
Selected indices: [1, 5]
Reasoning:
Image 1 is a simple close-up of one person with a clear, straightforward composition - just a face with a warm smile, no complex layering or problematic angles. Image 5 is a split-screen illustration showing both people in separate panels, which provides the pastel illustration style without risking Seedream copying a single unified composition that could create duplicate characters. Both images have clean, simple framing. I'm avoiding Image 0 (could have foreground/background issues), Image 2 (side view composition might be copied), Image 3 (top-down angle is very specific), and Image 4 (hands-only detail shot doesn't show characters clearly). Using only 2 references reduces compositional reinforcement while still providing the friendly, pastel aesthetic needed for this compliment exchange moment.

LINE 8: It's so pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image 8 needs to capture the compliment 'It's so pretty / 너무 예뻐요' with a fresh composition. Previous images showed: close-ups of individuals, wide shots of both at table, bird's eye view, hands over table, split screen, and elevated three-quarter view. For this compliment moment, I'll create a unique composition focusing on ONE person's delighted reaction as they receive the compliment - a side profile view showing their genuine smile and pleased expression, with soft dreamy bokeh effects in the background suggesting the warm atmosphere. This single-character reaction shot is compositionally distinct from all previous images which either showed both people or focused on objects/hands. The side profile angle and intimate framing of just one person's joyful expression creates a new visual moment.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright friendly flat illustration in pastel colors, side profile view of a young Korean person with short bob haircut, face showing genuine delighted smile and slightly bashful pleased expression, eyes sparkling with joy, one hand gently touching their cheek in a flattered gesture, soft pink blush on cheeks, warm yellow and soft pink dreamy bokeh circles floating in the background creating a glowing atmosphere, mint green and peach color accents, clean modern illustration style with smooth lines, warm and sweet mood capturing the feeling of receiving a sincere compliment

REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-6
Selected indices: [6, 1]
Reasoning:
Image 6 is the most recent and shows both characters clearly visible in a medium three-quarter angle view - both friends are present without any over-shoulder or foreground/background layering issues. Image 1 provides a clean close-up face reference with a warm smile that matches the compliment context ('It's so pretty') without any compositional complexity - it's a simple, straightforward close-up that won't cause duplicate character issues. Using only 2 references keeps compositional reinforcement minimal while providing good style guidance for the friendly, warm tone of the compliment moment. Avoiding images 4 (hands only, might cause compositional copying) and 5 (split screen could be problematic).

LINE 9: Do you want to be friends?
================================================================================

Korean: 우리 친구할래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the pivotal friendship invitation moment - the emotional climax of the sequence. Previous images have shown: waist-up meeting (1), close-up face (2), wide side view (3), top-down bird's eye (4), hands detail (5), split screen (6), three-quarter elevated view (7), and side profile (8). For this crucial lyric asking to be friends, I need something that feels warm, open, and inviting. I'll create a direct frontal view of ONE person (the one asking) with an outstretched hand gesture toward camera/viewer, as if reaching out in friendship. This perspective makes the viewer feel like they ARE the other person being asked. The hand reaching forward creates depth and intimacy we haven't used yet. The background can show soft bokeh cafe elements to keep focus on this genuine moment of connection.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright friendly flat illustration in pastel colors, frontal straight-on view of a young Korean person with short bob haircut looking directly at viewer with warm genuine smile, one hand extended forward toward camera in friendly welcoming gesture as if offering friendship, hand in mid-reach creating depth, other hand resting naturally at side, wearing casual mint green sweater, soft bokeh cafe background with blurred warm yellow lights and pastel pink elements, shallow depth of field effect keeping focus on person's face and extended hand, warm inviting atmosphere, gentle expression with hopeful eyes, clean modern illustration style with soft shadows


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-7
Selected indices: [7, 3]
Reasoning:
Image 7 is a simple side profile close-up of one person showing delighted emotion - perfect for capturing the excited/friendly feeling of asking 'Do you want to be friends?' without complex composition that could be copied. Image 3 is a bird's eye view of both people at the table - a distinctly different angle that provides the 2-person context and pastel illustration style. These two refs are compositionally diverse (profile vs top-down), both avoid problematic framing elements (no backs, no over-shoulder, no foreground blur), and together provide the warm, friendly illustration style while letting Seedream interpret the friendship invitation moment freshly.

LINE 10: Do you wanna drink coffee?
================================================================================

Korean: 커피 마실래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the final image of the sequence, so it needs to be a memorable, warm conclusion that captures the invitation to friendship. All previous images have shown either: seated conversations at the table, close-ups of faces, hands gesturing, bird's eye views, or split screens. For image #10, I want something that feels like a 'yes' moment - the acceptance of friendship. I'll create a composition showing both people STANDING UP from the table together, captured from a low angle looking slightly up at them, suggesting they're about to leave together or continue their conversation elsewhere. This standing/movement composition hasn't been used yet and conveys the forward momentum of a new friendship beginning. The coffee cups on the table in foreground anchor the cafe setting while the characters are in mid-action, creating energy and optimism.

Seedream Prompt:
Bright friendly flat illustration in pastel colors, low angle view looking slightly upward at two young Korean friends standing up from their cafe table together, both figures shown from knees up in full view, one person with short bob haircut wearing a soft pink cardigan, the other with shoulder-length hair in a mint green top, both smiling warmly at each other as they rise from their seats, the small round cafe table visible in lower foreground with two coffee cups still on it, chairs pushed back slightly, warm yellow and soft blue background suggesting cafe interior, sense of movement and positive energy, clean modern illustration style with smooth shapes and gentle shadows, inviting and joyful atmosphere

REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-8
Selected indices: [8, 6]
Reasoning:
Image 8 provides a clean frontal view of a single character looking directly at viewer - simple, straightforward composition with clear character design and style reference. Image 6 offers a medium three-quarter elevated angle of both friends in a moment of connection - both characters clearly visible without problematic over-shoulder, POV, or foreground elements. Together they provide strong style/color/character references without complex layered compositions that could cause Seedream to duplicate framing. Using only 2 refs reduces compositional reinforcement risk while maintaining style consistency for this coffee invitation moment.
