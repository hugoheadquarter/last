Seedream Prompt:
A warm, friendly illustrated scene in a modern Korean cafe with soft pastel colors and natural lighting streaming through large windows. A young woman with flowing dark hair wearing a cream cardigan stands nearby a young man with casual styled hair wearing a light blue shirt, both in their twenties. The woman is smiling warmly and leaning slightly forward in a friendly greeting gesture, while the young man sits at a small wooden cafe table with a coffee cup, looking up at her with a pleasant surprised expression. The cafe interior features light wooden furniture, potted plants on shelves, and soft warm yellow sunlight creating a cheerful, inviting atmosphere. Contemporary Korean cafe aesthetic with clean lines, minimal decor, and a cozy ambiance. Both characters are prominently featured in the frame within the same unified space, drawn in a soft, approachable illustrated style with gentle colors and realistic but slightly stylized proportions. Square composition, 1080x1080 pixels.

LINE 2: Your name is pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 이름이 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Image 1 showed a wider establishing shot with both characters at a distance in the cafe environment. For Image 2, I'm creating a distinctly different composition with a closer, more intimate framing - a medium shot focused on the young woman's face and upper body as she speaks directly to the young man, with him visible but slightly out of focus in the foreground/side of frame. This creates visual variety through: 1) Much closer camera distance, 2) Over-the-shoulder perspective rather than wide two-shot, 3) The woman is now the active speaker with animated, warm expression, 4) Different spatial relationship showing depth between characters, 5) Focus on her gesture and facial expression as she compliments his name. The cafe setting remains but is now softer/blurred background elements.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium shot in a modern Korean cafe with soft pastel decor and warm natural lighting. The young woman from the character reference is centered in frame, shown from chest up, with a bright warm smile and sparkling eyes as she speaks. She has one hand gently raised in a friendly conversational gesture near her chest. Her expression is genuinely complimentary and engaging. The young man from the character reference is partially visible in the foreground right side, slightly out of focus, showing the back/side of his head and shoulder, creating an over-the-shoulder perspective. Soft bokeh cafe background with blurred warm lights, pastel walls, and hints of cafe details. Warm golden hour lighting illuminating her face. Shallow depth of field emphasizing her animated, friendly expression. Contemporary young adult aesthetic with approachable, cheerful mood.

Korean: 몇살이에요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Images 1-2 showed medium shots with both characters visible in conversational poses. To create distinct visual variety for the age question, I'm switching to a close-up shot focusing primarily on the young woman's curious, engaging expression as she asks the question. The camera angle shifts to an over-the-shoulder perspective from behind the young man (we see the back of his head/shoulder in foreground), creating depth and intimacy. This framing emphasizes her attentive, friendly demeanor while maintaining his presence in the frame. The gesture changes to her leaning forward slightly with an inquisitive tilt of her head, hands perhaps clasped together on the table, showing genuine interest in getting to know him.

Seedream Prompt:
Close-up over-the-shoulder shot in a modern Korean cafe with soft pastel walls and warm natural window lighting. Camera positioned from behind the young man (back of his head and shoulder visible in foreground, slightly out of focus), facing the young woman from the character reference. She leans forward slightly across the cafe table with an curious, friendly expression, head tilted inquisitively to one side, eyes bright and engaged. Her hands are clasped together on the wooden table surface. Warm afternoon sunlight creates a soft glow. Coffee cups and cafe items visible on table between them. Blurred cafe interior with plants and pastel decor in background. Warm, inviting atmosphere with shallow depth of field emphasizing her expressive face. Contemporary Korean aesthetic with natural, friendly mood.

================================================================================
LINE 4: You look so young
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 어려보여요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous scenes showed: (1) wide establishing shot of both at separate tables, (2) medium shot of woman speaking, (3) close-up over-shoulder of man responding. For Image 4, I'm creating a DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT composition: a medium-close shot focused on the YOUNG MAN'S REACTION as the woman comments on his youthful appearance. This reverses the focus from previous images - we see HIS face clearly now, perhaps with a shy smile or slight embarrassment at being told he looks young. The woman is visible but partially in frame (side profile or back of head), creating a different dynamic. The camera angle is straight-on to his face rather than over-shoulder, and his body language shows a humble, slightly self-conscious reaction - maybe touching his face or neck, looking down briefly with a smile. This provides visual variety through: different subject focus (man instead of woman), different emotional beat (receiving compliment vs giving it), different framing (straight-on medium-close vs previous angles), and different character interaction (reactive vs active speaking).

Seedream Prompt:
Medium-close shot in a modern Korean cafe with soft pastel walls, wooden tables, and warm natural window lighting. The young man from the character reference sits at a cafe table, facing the camera at a slight angle. He has a shy, humble smile and slightly embarrassed expression as he reacts to a compliment, perhaps touching the back of his neck or looking down modestly with a gentle laugh. He wears his casual comfortable clothing. The young woman from the character reference is partially visible in the foreground (side profile or back of her head with her dark hair), seated across from him, creating depth. Warm afternoon light filters through large windows, illuminating cafe plants and coffee cups on their table. The scene captures his youthful, endearing reaction to being told he looks young. Warm, friendly illustrated style with soft pastel colors and natural lighting. Contemporary Korean cafe atmosphere with realistic details.

LINE 5: What is your hobby
================================================================================

Korean: 취미가 뭐예요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
Previous images have been standard conversational shots - medium shots and close-ups of faces talking. For 'What is your hobby,' I'm creating a distinctly different visual approach: a wide shot showing the young woman leaning forward with animated, curious body language, gesturing with her hands as she asks the question. The young man is shown from a side angle, looking thoughtful with his hand near his chin. This breaks from the previous head-on conversation shots by showing more full-body language, dynamic gestures, and capturing the energy of an enthusiastic question. The camera pulls back more to show the cafe table between them with coffee cups, creating environmental context and spatial relationship that wasn't emphasized before.

Seedream Prompt:
Wide shot in a modern Korean cafe with soft pastel walls, hanging plants, and warm natural window lighting. The young woman with long dark hair wearing a light-colored top is seated at a wooden cafe table, leaning forward energetically with both hands gesturing expressively as she asks a question, her face bright and curious with raised eyebrows and an engaging smile. Across from her, the young man with dark hair wearing a casual green shirt is shown from a three-quarter angle, sitting back slightly with one hand thoughtfully near his chin, looking contemplative as he considers his answer. Two coffee cups and a small plant centerpiece sit on the wooden table between them. Other cafe details visible in background - chairs, windows, soft bokeh lighting. Warm, friendly illustrated style with soft pastel colors. The scene captures the dynamic energy of an enthusiastic question being asked.

LINE 6: I like it too
================================================================================

Korean: 저도 좋아해요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene marks a moment of shared enthusiasm and connection. To differentiate from previous shots: Image 1 was a wide establishing shot, Image 2 was a medium shot of the woman standing, Image 3 was an over-the-shoulder close-up of the man, Image 4 was a medium-close of both at the table, and Image 5 was a wide shot with the woman gesturing. For Image 6, I'm creating a close-up two-shot focusing on their faces and upper bodies as they lean slightly toward each other across the table, showing genuine warmth and mutual interest. The camera angle is straight-on at eye level, capturing both their expressions simultaneously in a more intimate framing that emphasizes their growing rapport. Their body language shows engagement - perhaps both smiling, with the woman's hands visible holding her coffee cup and the man leaning forward slightly. This creates visual variety through tighter framing, dual focus on both faces equally, and a sense of closeness that reflects the 'me too' sentiment of shared interest.

Seedream Prompt:
Close-up two-shot in a modern Korean cafe with soft pastel walls and warm natural window lighting. The young woman with long straight black hair and the young man with short black hair and glasses are seated across from each other at a wooden table, both visible from chest up. They are leaning slightly toward each other, both smiling warmly with expressions of genuine interest and connection. The woman holds a coffee cup in her hands, the man has his hands resting on the table. Soft bokeh background shows blurred cafe interior with hanging plants. Warm, friendly illustrated style with soft pastel colors. Natural afternoon lighting creates a cozy, intimate atmosphere. Focus on both characters' faces showing mutual enthusiasm and emerging friendship.

LINE 7: Where did you get that clothe
================================================================================

Korean: 그 옷 어디서 샀어요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene breaks from previous patterns by showing a fashion detail moment. Instead of face-to-face conversation shots or wide establishing shots, this uses a medium shot focused on the young man's clothing with the woman gesturing toward or touching his sleeve/shirt, creating a more playful, intimate interaction. The camera angle is slightly lower and offset, capturing both the clothing detail and their interaction from a fresh perspective. This creates visual variety through: 1) Focus on clothing/fashion detail rather than just faces, 2) More physical interaction with gesturing toward clothing, 3) Different spatial arrangement with characters positioned to highlight the garment, 4) A warmer, more casual body language moment that differs from the polite conversation framing of previous shots.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium shot in a modern Korean cafe with soft pastel walls, hanging plants, and warm natural window lighting. The young woman with long dark hair wearing a cream cardigan is leaning forward slightly, her hand gesturing toward or lightly touching the young man's shirt sleeve, examining his clothing with an animated, impressed expression and bright smile. The young man with short dark hair wearing a light blue button-up shirt sits with a slightly bashful, pleased smile, looking down at his shirt briefly then back at her. Camera angle is slightly from the side, capturing both their upper bodies and the clothing detail she's commenting on. Warm afternoon sunlight, cozy cafe atmosphere with coffee cups on the wooden table between them. Friendly, playful interaction moment with natural body language. Soft, inviting color palette with warm yellows and pastel tones.

LINE 8: It's so pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This scene shifts dramatically from previous shots by focusing on the young woman's perspective and emotion. While previous images showed conversations, exchanges, and the man's reactions, this one zeroes in on the WOMAN'S admiration - she's commenting that something is 'so pretty.' I'm creating an extreme close-up of HER face showing genuine delight and warmth as she looks at him, with him visible but softly out of focus in the background. This is our first extreme close-up of the woman's facial expression, and the shallow depth of field creates an intimate, almost dreamy quality that matches the compliment. The camera angle is from slightly below, making it feel personal and capturing her genuine smile and sparkling eyes. This contrasts with previous medium shots, two-shots, and over-shoulder compositions.

Seedream Prompt:
Extreme close-up shot in a modern Korean cafe with soft pastel walls and warm natural window lighting creating a gentle glow. The young woman with long black hair and bangs fills the foreground in sharp focus, her face angled slightly toward the camera with a genuine, warm smile and bright, sparkling eyes showing admiration and delight. Her expression is soft and genuinely complimentary, with natural happiness radiating from her features. In the soft bokeh background, the young man with short black hair and casual clothing is visible but beautifully out of focus, sitting across from her. Warm yellow and cream tones dominate, with dreamy soft-focus cafe details like blurred hanging plants and window light creating lens flares. Shallow depth of field creates an intimate, tender atmosphere. Warm, friendly illustrated style with soft pastel colors and natural lighting. Contemporary Korean young adult aesthetic with approachable, heartfelt mood.

LINE 9: Do you want to be friends?
================================================================================

Korean: 우리 친구할래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the climactic moment where she directly asks to be friends. Previous images have been conversational shots - over-shoulder, close-ups, medium shots of them talking. For this pivotal question, I'm creating a distinctly different composition: a wide-angle shot from a high corner perspective of the cafe, showing the entire table from above/diagonal angle. The young woman is leaning forward across the table with both hands extended toward him in an inviting, hopeful gesture, while the young man is slightly pulled back in his chair, showing his surprised but pleased reaction. This overhead/elevated angle hasn't been used yet and gives a cinematic 'moment of truth' feeling. The table between them with coffee cups, pastries, and cafe items creates a natural barrier that she's physically reaching across, symbolizing the friendship offer. This wide environmental shot contrasts sharply with the extreme close-up of image 8.

Seedream Prompt:
High angle wide shot in a modern Korean cafe with soft pastel walls, wooden floor, hanging plants, and large windows with warm natural sunlight. Camera positioned from elevated diagonal corner perspective looking down at a round wooden table. The young woman with long light brown hair wearing a cream cardigan is leaning forward across the table, both arms extended toward the young man in an inviting friendly gesture, her face bright and hopeful with a warm smile. The young man with dark hair wearing a denim jacket sits across from her, leaning slightly back in his chair with a surprised but happy expression, one hand raised near his chest in a 'who, me?' gesture. The table between them has two coffee cups, small plates with pastries, napkins, and sugar packets. Other cafe tables visible in background with soft bokeh effect. Warm, inviting atmosphere with soft pastel tones, natural window lighting creating gentle shadows. Warm friendly illustrated style with clean contemporary aesthetic.

LINE 10: Do you wanna drink coffee?
================================================================================

Korean: 커피 마실래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the final image, the climax of the conversation where she asks him to have coffee together. After 9 images of various angles and positions, I need something that feels conclusive and welcoming. Previous images included wide shots, close-ups, and over-the-shoulder angles. For this finale, I'll create a LOW ANGLE shot looking UP at both characters standing together at the cafe counter, with the barista area and menu boards visible behind/above them, showing them actively ordering coffee together. This perspective hasn't been used yet and symbolizes the beginning of their friendship. The low angle makes them look approachable and confident, and places them in the active service area rather than just sitting. This gives physical movement to the 'let's have coffee' moment.

Seedream Prompt:
Low angle shot in a modern Korean cafe looking up at two young people standing together at the counter. The young woman with long dark hair wearing a light cardigan and the young man with short dark hair wearing a beige hoodie are both standing side by side, looking at the menu board above. The cafe counter is visible with an espresso machine, cups, and pastries in a glass display case. Menu boards and pendant lights hang from the ceiling above. Warm natural lighting from windows to the side creates a golden glow. The barista area has wooden counter surfaces and light green subway tiles. Both characters have friendly, engaged expressions as they prepare to order. Shot from below eye level, looking up at approximately 30-degree angle. Soft pastel color palette with warm yellows and light blues. Inviting, friendly atmosphere with depth and realistic cafe details.
