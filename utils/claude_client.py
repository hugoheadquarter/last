Full song context:
{all_lyrics}

Target segment we're generating:

Song description: {song_metadata.get('description', 'N/A')}

Analyze the lyrics:
1. Is this a conversation between two people, or a solo narrative?
2. What's happening in this segment? (brief story summary)

FIXED VISUAL STYLE:
You must use high-quality Korean webtoon art style with these characteristics:
- Clean digital illustration with smooth linework
- Soft, natural color palette (pastels, warm tones, muted colors)
- Expressive faces with detailed eyes
- Modern, trendy fashion
- Atmospheric lighting and subtle gradients
- Professional webtoon quality (think Lezhin, Naver Webtoon premium series)

IMPORTANT RULES:
- If this is a CONVERSATION (lyrics use "you/your", questions/responses between people):
  → Must feature TWO characters of OPPOSITE SEX (one male, one female)
- Characters should be placed in WEBTOON ENVIRONMENTS (cafe, park, street, room)
- NO abstract colored backgrounds or gradient backgrounds
- NO split-screen compositions

- Characters should fill significant frame space
- People are the primary focus

- Must be a WEBTOON PLACE: cafe interior, park, street, room, etc with details

Use these EXACT character descriptions in your scene.

YOUR JOB:
Create a NEW SCENE for this lyric using those same characters with their exact appearance.

SCENE REQUIREMENTS:
- Place characters in a WEBTOON ENVIRONMENT (cafe, park, street, room with details)
- Characters should look EXACTLY as described in the reference prompts
- SAME outfits, SAME hairstyles, SAME features
- Characters should fill significant frame space
- NO abstract/solid color backgrounds
- NO split-screen or divided compositions
- NO divider lines between characters
- Characters in unified space

SCENE CONTINUITY:
{'- Keep both characters present (ongoing conversation)' if is_conversation else ''}
- If lyric says "you/your" → other person must be visible
- Scene can change naturally if lyric suggests it

CRITICAL: VISUAL VARIETY
Look at previous scenes. Make this one DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT:
- Different camera work
- Different character positions/interactions
- Different character gestures/face expressions
- Different framing
- NOT just expression changes or slight variations

Think about how the scene composition, character arrangement, and perspective can tell the story differently.

FORBIDDEN:
- NO text
- DO NOT change character appearance (outfits, hair, features)

IMPORTANT: Characters should not look at the viewer. Instead, they must direct their gaze toward each other, toward objects in the environment, toward what they are gesturing at, etc.
