LINE 2: Your name is pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 이름이 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is a continuous conversation scene in the café. The lyric is a direct compliment ('Your name is pretty'), indicating active dialogue between the two characters. Image 1 was a wide establishing shot showing both people with one waving. For Image 2, I need to show the moment of the compliment being given - this calls for a more intimate framing that captures the warmth and connection forming. I'm choosing a MEDIUM CLOSE-UP from a SIDE ANGLE at EYE LEVEL, focusing on one person speaking the compliment while the other's reaction is visible in soft focus or profile. This creates visual variety by: (1) moving much closer than the wide shot, (2) using a side perspective instead of straight-on, (3) creating depth with foreground/background character placement. This angle feels more personal and intimate, matching the sweet, slightly nervous energy of someone giving a genuine compliment.

Seedream Prompt:
Medium close-up shot from side angle at eye level, soft focus depth of field. Foreground: young person in profile speaking with warm smile and slightly bashful expression, gentle hand gesture near heart. Background: slightly out of focus, the other person's face showing delighted surprise and shy smile, eyes bright. Bright modern Korean café interior with soft window light creating gentle rim lighting on hair. Pastel peach and mint green color palette, warm afternoon sunlight streaming through windows. Coffee cups on table between them slightly blurred in mid-ground. Soft bokeh effects with hints of café plants and hanging lights. Dreamy, romantic friendship energy. Animated style with soft gradients, subtle texture overlays on walls. Lavender and soft yellow accents in clothing. Clean modern aesthetic with rounded shapes. Intimate, heartwarming moment captured with cinematic depth. Gentle glow and warm atmosphere.

REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-0
Selected indices: [0]
Reasoning:
Image 0 is a wide shot establishing the café meeting scene with both characters visible. For Line 2 ('Your name is pretty'), we need a 2-person composition but want to avoid reinforcing the same wide angle. By selecting only Image 0 as reference, we maintain style consistency (art style, character designs, café atmosphere) while leaving the AI free to explore different compositional angles for this compliment moment - potentially a closer shot focusing on facial expressions or a different perspective that captures the intimacy of the compliment. Since we only have one previous image and it's a wide establishing shot, selecting just this single reference provides style guidance without locking the composition, allowing natural variety as the conversation progresses.

LINE 3: How old are you
================================================================================

Korean: 몇살이에요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is a continuous conversation scene in the café. The lyric asks about age, continuing the getting-to-know-you dialogue. Both characters must be present since it's a direct question ('you'). Image 1 was a wide establishing shot, Image 2 was a medium close-up side profile focused on one speaker. For Image 3, I need a distinctly different composition. I'll use a HIGH ANGLE shot looking down at both people at their café table, creating an overhead/bird's eye perspective. This gives us a fresh viewpoint showing both characters simultaneously, their body language, and the intimate café table setting between them. It's conversational and allows us to see their interaction from above, which contrasts sharply with the side profile and wide shots already used.

Seedream Prompt:
High angle overhead shot looking down at café table from above, slightly tilted bird's eye view perspective. Two young people sitting across from each other at small round café table, both visible from above. One person leaning forward slightly with curious, friendly expression, the other sitting back with relaxed open posture. Between them: café table with two coffee cups, small dessert plates, napkins. Warm wooden table surface. Hands visible gesturing naturally in conversation. Bright modern Korean café setting, soft natural sunlight streaming across table creating gentle shadows. Pastel color palette with peach, mint green, lavender accents. Clean minimalist aesthetic. Animated style with soft lighting, friendly welcoming atmosphere. Both characters have distinct hairstyles visible from above. Cozy intimate framing showing the connection between two new potential friends. Warm afternoon glow, gentle depth of field on background café elements.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-1
Selected indices: [0]
Reasoning:
Both Image 0 and Image 1 show two people interacting in conversation, which matches the current lyric's 'you' context. However, they have very similar compositions: both are close-range shots focusing on the conversational exchange between two people. Image 0 is a wide shot showing the full café setting, while Image 1 is a medium close-up from the side at eye level. Since Image 1 is the most recent and uses a tighter framing that could create compositional lock if reinforced, I'm selecting only Image 0. This provides the necessary style consistency (modern café setting, character designs, warm color palette) while leaving maximum compositional freedom for the current prompt to explore a different angle or framing - perhaps a reverse angle, different distance, or alternative perspective that adds visual variety to the sequence.

================================================================================
LINE 4: You look so young
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 어려보여요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is a continuous conversation scene - the two characters are still getting to know each other in the café. The lyric 'You look so young' is a direct compliment being spoken between them, so both characters must be visible. Previous shots: (1) wide establishing shot, (2) medium close-up side profile of one speaking, (3) overhead bird's eye view of table. For image #4, I need something distinctly different. I'll use a LOW ANGLE shot from below, looking slightly upward at the person receiving the compliment. This creates an intimate, flattering perspective that visually reinforces the 'you look young' compliment - the low angle naturally creates a hero/positive framing. The other person will be visible but slightly out of focus in the background/side, showing they're speaking TO this person. This angle hasn't been used yet and adds cinematic variety while maintaining the warm, friendly energy.

Seedream Prompt:
Low angle shot from below looking slightly upward, shallow depth of field with bokeh effect. Foreground in sharp focus: young person with surprised pleased expression, hand touching their own cheek in shy flattered gesture, soft golden hour lighting catching their face from above, warm peachy glow on their skin, eyes bright and sparkling with delight. Background softly blurred: second person partially visible in soft focus with friendly smile, suggesting they just gave a compliment. Setting is bright modern Korean café with large windows, pastel mint green and lavender accents, hanging plants creating dappled light patterns, wooden furniture. Animated style with soft watercolor textures, warm pastel color palette dominated by peach tones and soft yellows, gentle gradient lighting, cute illustrated sparkles and flower petals floating in the air around the flattered person's face, cheerful welcoming atmosphere, afternoon sunbeams creating lens flare effects, cozy intimate friendship moment


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-2
Selected indices: [0, 2]
Reasoning:
Image 0 provides a wide establishing shot showing both people with one waving - a distant, full-body perspective. Image 2 offers a completely different high-angle overhead bird's eye view looking down at the table. These two compositions are maximally different from each other (wide vs overhead, eye-level vs bird's eye). I'm skipping Image 1 because it's a medium close-up side profile shot, which could create compositional lock if combined with either of the others. For the current lyric 'You look so young' addressing another person, having references with 2 characters is appropriate. Using only 2 references reduces the risk of compositional reinforcement while maintaining style consistency through the character designs and café setting.

LINE 5: What is your hobby
================================================================================

Korean: 취미가 뭐예요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is a continuous conversation scene in the café. The lyric 'What is your hobby' continues the getting-to-know-you dialogue, so both characters must be present and engaged. Previous shots: #1 wide establishing, #2 medium close-up side profile, #3 overhead bird's eye, #4 low angle upward. For #5, I need something completely different. I'll use an OVER-THE-SHOULDER shot from behind one character looking at the other - this creates intimacy and shows the conversational exchange while being a fresh perspective we haven't used yet. This angle naturally shows one person asking the question while we see the other's reaction, perfect for this dialogue moment.

Seedream Prompt:
Over-the-shoulder shot from behind one person's back, looking past their shoulder and side of their head in soft focus foreground, focusing on the other young person's face across the café table in sharp focus. The person in focus is listening thoughtfully with a warm smile, hands gesturing expressively as they prepare to answer. Bright modern Korean café interior with soft pastel lighting, mint green and peach tones. Warm afternoon sunlight streaming through windows creating gentle highlights. Two coffee cups on the wooden table between them. Friendly, intimate conversation atmosphere. Shallow depth of field with the speaker's shoulder and hair slightly blurred in extreme foreground, creating depth. Cheerful, welcoming mood with soft texture overlays and gradient lighting. Clean modern aesthetic with rounded furniture shapes visible in background blur.

REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-3
Selected indices: [0, 2]
Reasoning:
Image 0 provides a wide establishing shot showing both characters in the café space - this gives overall style reference. Image 2 offers a completely different perspective with its high-angle overhead/bird's eye view of the café table, creating strong compositional diversity. I'm avoiding Image 1 (medium close-up profile) and Image 3 (low angle looking upward) because they both focus on individual character reactions with similar framing intensity. For the current lyric about hobbies (conversational question requiring both people), selecting two very different compositions (wide shot + overhead) ensures style consistency while preventing the AI from locking into repetitive medium/close-up reaction shots. The overhead angle from Image 2 is particularly valuable as it's distinct from all other angles used so far.

================================================================================
LINE 6: I like it too
================================================================================

Korean: 저도 좋아해요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is a continuous café conversation where two people are discovering shared interests. The lyric 'I like it too' is an enthusiastic agreement, suggesting a moment of connection and shared excitement. Previous shots covered: wide establishing (1), side medium close-up (2), overhead table view (3), low angle looking up (4), and over-shoulder (5). For image 6, I need a completely fresh angle that captures this moment of mutual enthusiasm. I'll use a DUTCH ANGLE (tilted camera) MEDIUM-WIDE SHOT from a diagonal perspective, positioned between the two characters at table height, creating dynamic energy that matches the excitement of discovering commonality. This tilted, off-center composition hasn't been used yet and visually represents the 'spark' of connection forming.

Seedream Prompt:
Dutch angle tilted camera shot at 25-degree diagonal tilt, medium-wide framing from table height perspective positioned diagonally between two young people. Dynamic asymmetrical composition with café table slightly tilted in frame. Two friends sitting across from each other, both leaning forward in animated conversation with bright excited expressions, hands gesturing enthusiastically over shared interest. Warm afternoon sunlight streaming through large café windows creating diagonal light rays across the scene. Bright friendly animated art style with soft pastel colors - peach walls, mint green accent chairs, lavender decorative elements, soft yellow sunlight glow. Clean modern Korean café aesthetic with potted plants and minimalist décor visible in tilted background. Foreground shows corner of wooden table with two colorful drinks (iced latte with cute latte art, pastel smoothie). Both characters have warm welcoming body language, smiling genuinely, creating cozy atmosphere of friendship forming. Shallow depth of field with softly blurred background café patrons. Cheerful mood with gentle texture overlays, warm color grading that feels like sunny afternoon. Modern illustration style with rounded shapes and soft shadows.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-4
Selected indices: [0, 2]
Reasoning:
Image 0 provides a wide establishing shot showing both people with one waving - a full scene composition. Image 2 offers a completely different overhead bird's eye view looking down at the table. These two compositions are extremely distinct (wide horizontal vs. overhead vertical perspective) and will provide style consistency without reinforcing any similar framing. I'm avoiding Images 1, 3, and 4 because: Image 1 is a medium close-up side profile, Image 3 is a low angle close-up, and Image 4 is an over-shoulder shot - all three are relatively similar in that they focus on individual faces/expressions at closer ranges from different but still character-focused angles. Since the current lyric 'I like it too' shows agreement between two people, selecting images that show both characters (0 and 2) is appropriate. Using only 2 references reduces compositional reinforcement while maintaining maximum variety between a wide environmental shot and a unique overhead perspective.

LINE 7: Where did you get that clothe
================================================================================

Korean: 그 옷 어디서 샀어요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is a continuous café conversation scene. The lyric is a compliment about clothing, which is a natural progression in their getting-to-know-you dialogue. Both characters must be present since it's direct dialogue ('you'). Previous shots covered: wide establishing, medium close profile, overhead table view, low angle upward, over-shoulder, and Dutch angle table height. For shot 7, I'll use an EXTREME CLOSE-UP focusing on clothing details with the person wearing it partially visible, creating an intimate moment that shows what they're admiring. This is distinctly different - it's the tightest framing yet, focusing on a specific object (the outfit) rather than faces or full bodies, while still keeping both people in the frame through reflection or partial visibility. It's like the camera is showing us exactly what caught their eye.

Seedream Prompt:
Extreme close-up shot, macro detail perspective at chest level, shallow depth of field with creamy bokeh. Sharp focus on: stylish pastel mint green cardigan with delicate pearl buttons and soft knit texture, worn by young person visible from neck to waist only (no face shown). Background: soft out-of-focus silhouette of another person leaning forward admiringly across café table, warm peachy lighting halos around them. Foreground person's hands gently touching their own cardigan fabric. Café environment blurred into dreamy lavender and soft yellow bokeh circles. Warm afternoon sunlight filtering through, creating gentle highlights on fabric texture. Cozy intimate framing that captures the moment of receiving a compliment. Bright friendly animated style with soft pastel color palette, clean modern Korean aesthetic, gentle gradients, welcoming cheerful mood with subtle texture overlays.

REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-5
Selected indices: [5, 3, 0]
Reasoning:
These three images provide maximum compositional diversity while maintaining 2-person character count for the current lyric's conversational context:

- Image 5 (Dutch angle, table-height diagonal): Most recent with unique tilted perspective that hasn't been repeated, provides contemporary style reference
- Image 3 (Low angle looking upward): Completely different vertical perspective from Image 5, showing surprised expression which adds emotional variety
- Image 0 (Wide shot): Establishes full scene context with different framing distance than the closer shots in 3 and 5

Avoided:
- Images 1, 2: Medium close-up and overhead shots are good but create middle-ground redundancy
- Image 4: Over-the-shoulder with soft focus foreground is compositionally complex and could cause character bleeding issues

This selection spans wide→low angle→diagonal tilted perspectives with no overlapping camera work, ensuring the AI draws style/color/character design from references without locking into repetitive framing for the clothing compliment scene.

LINE 8: It's so pretty
================================================================================

Korean: 너무 예뻐요


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is a continuous café conversation scene. The lyric 'It's so pretty' is a compliment being given - likely about the other person's name, appearance, or something they're wearing, as mentioned in the story context. After 7 shots exploring various angles (wide, medium close-up, overhead, low angle, over-shoulder, dutch angle, and extreme macro of clothing), I need a completely fresh perspective. I'm choosing a TRACKING DOLLY SHOT - a side-profile medium shot that captures both people in the same frame at equal prominence, showing the moment of giving/receiving a compliment. This is different because: (1) It's a lateral perspective we haven't used, (2) Both subjects are equally in focus and prominence side-by-side, (3) It has a 'moving camera' quality frozen in time, (4) It captures the interpersonal dynamic between them rather than favoring one perspective. The composition will feel balanced and symmetrical, emphasizing their connection at this sweet moment of compliment-giving.

Seedream Prompt:
Lateral tracking shot, side profile perspective at seated eye level, medium two-shot composition with both subjects framed equally in profile facing each other across café table. Balanced symmetrical framing with shallow depth of field. Left side: young person with warm expression giving genuine compliment, soft smile, eyes bright and friendly, leaning slightly forward with open body language. Right side: young person receiving compliment with shy pleased expression, gentle blush on cheeks, modest smile, hand touching cheek in bashful gesture. Between them on table: two coffee cups with latte art, small potted succulent plant, soft afternoon sunlight streaming through large windows creating warm glow. Background softly blurred showing mint green and peach café interior, hanging plants, other patrons as soft bokeh orbs of light. Pastel color palette: peach tones, mint green accents, lavender highlights, soft yellow sunlight, creamy whites. Gentle film grain texture, bright and airy atmosphere, warm golden hour lighting from side window creating soft rim light on hair and shoulders. Animated Korean café aesthetic, clean modern design, friendly welcoming mood capturing the sweet moment of compliment and connection between two new potential friends.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-6
Selected indices: [3, 6]
Reasoning:
Image 3 provides a low angle shot with surprised expression showing emotional reaction - perfect for capturing the moment of receiving a compliment. Image 6 is an extreme close-up macro shot of clothing details at chest level, which directly aligns with the 'pretty' compliment lyric focusing on aesthetic details. These two are compositionally distinct (low angle face shot vs extreme close-up detail shot) while avoiding the problematic compositions like Image 4's over-shoulder or the repeated table-view angles from Images 2 and 5. Both show different aspects needed for a compliment scene: the emotional reaction and the visual detail being complimented. Using only 2 references prevents compositional lock while maintaining style consistency from recent images.

LINE 9: Do you want to be friends?
================================================================================

Korean: 우리 친구할래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the climactic moment of the continuous café conversation where one person extends the friendship invitation. After 8 shots covering various angles (wide, medium close-up, overhead, low angle, over-shoulder, dutch tilt, extreme close-up of hands, and lateral tracking), I need a fresh perspective that captures the emotional weight of this question. I'm choosing a PUSH-IN DOLLY SHOT with a centered frontal composition - starting slightly wider and implying forward movement toward the person asking the question. This creates intimacy and vulnerability, showing their hopeful, slightly nervous expression as they pose this important question. The camera position is straight-on at eye level but with a sense of moving closer, which we haven't used yet. This frontal, direct approach contrasts with all the side profiles, angles, and overhead shots, and the implied forward motion adds cinematic energy to this pivotal friendship proposal moment.

Seedream Prompt:
Push-in dolly shot moving forward toward subject, frontal straight-on composition at seated eye level, medium-to-close framing. Center frame: young person sitting at café table facing camera directly, leaning forward slightly with hopeful earnest expression, eyes bright and vulnerable, gentle smile with hint of nervousness, hands clasped together or one hand gesturing invitingly. Soft window light from side creating gentle rim lighting on hair and shoulders. Shallow depth of field with background café interior (blurred pastel mint walls, soft yellow light fixtures, out-of-focus coffee cups and plants) creating dreamy bokeh. Second person visible as soft silhouette or blurred figure in extreme foreground bottom corner, suggesting camera perspective from their viewpoint. Bright friendly animated aesthetic, pastel peach and lavender tones, warm golden hour lighting filtering through, cozy intimate atmosphere. Soft texture overlay, gentle lens flare, cinematographic shallow focus with creamy background blur. Korean café modern minimalist design elements softly visible. Hopeful, sweet, vulnerable emotional tone of friendship invitation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available images: 0-7
Selected indices: [3, 6, 7]
Reasoning:
These three images provide maximum compositional diversity while maintaining style consistency:

Image 3: Low angle shot looking upward with surprised expression - unique vertical perspective from below, single person focus with emotional reaction

Image 6: Extreme close-up macro detail of clothing at chest level - dramatically different framing showing clothing detail rather than faces, provides style/color reference without compositional influence

Image 7: Lateral tracking side profile at eye level showing both people equally - most recent image, horizontal composition with dual subjects in profile

These avoid problematic patterns:
- Skipped Images 0, 1, 2, 4: All variations of standard eye-level medium shots that would reinforce conventional framing
- Skipped Image 5: Dutch angle is compositionally distinct but less recent
- Image 6 provides pure style reference (colors, clothing, aesthetic) without imposing facial composition

For the current lyric about extending friendship invitation, Image 7's equal dual-profile framing supports the 'we/us' dynamic, while Images 3 and 6 prevent compositional lock by offering radically different perspectives (low angle reaction + macro detail).

LINE 10: Do you wanna drink coffee?
================================================================================

Korean: 커피 마실래요?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE PROMPT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Reasoning:
This is the climactic moment of the continuous café scene - the coffee invitation that brings the entire sequence to a satisfying conclusion. All previous shots have focused on individual perspectives, two-shots, and table details. For this final image (#10), I need something that captures the warmth and completion of their new friendship forming. I'm choosing a WIDE PULL-BACK SHOT from a slightly elevated three-quarter angle, showing both people at the table in their full environment - the opposite of image 9's push-in dolly. This creates a bookend effect with image 1's wide shot, but from a different perspective and emotional tone. Where image 1 showed the tentative beginning, this shows the warm conclusion. The elevated angle gives us a complete view of their shared space, two coffee cups on the table between them, body language open and friendly, perhaps one person gesturing toward the coffee cups. This framing says 'we've arrived at friendship' and gives the sequence a satisfying visual closure without repeating any previous composition.

Seedream Prompt:
Wide establishing pull-back shot from elevated three-quarter angle positioned 8 feet above and diagonal to café table, expansive medium-wide framing showing full scene. Two young people seated at round modern café table, comfortable relaxed postures leaning slightly toward each other, genuine smiles and open body language suggesting friendship formed. Two steaming coffee cups prominently placed on table between them, one person's hand gesturing welcomingly toward the cups in friendly invitation. Bright airy modern Korean café interior with large windows casting warm afternoon sunlight, soft peachy-golden light flooding the space. Pastel mint green and lavender café chairs, light wood table, potted plants and hanging greenery visible in background. Warm inviting atmosphere with soft bokeh lights from café ambiance. Clean modern aesthetic with rounded furniture, minimal décor. Gentle gradient lighting from warm yellow to soft peach tones. Cozy friendship energy, the satisfied feeling of connection made. Soft texture overlays, dreamy pastel color grading with emphasis on warm welcoming tones. Cinematic composition with subjects positioned in lower two-thirds of frame, café environment completing the story context above and around them.
